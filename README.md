# idrive-apps

Tools and apps for the iDrive 7 head unit (MGU) of a BMW, installed from the
[mgu Store](https://github.com/robertnisipeanu/mgu-store).

| Path | |
|---|---|
| [`native/cluster-render`](native/cluster-render) | the cluster renderer: one service that draws every app's layers on the instrument cluster and the HUD |
| [`native/waze-on-cluster`](native/waze-on-cluster) | the CarPlay map (Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps) on the instrument cluster, drawn through cluster-render |
| [`apps/robertn_waze_cluster`](apps/robertn_waze_cluster) | the iDrive app for it: Enable map, Disable map, status |
| [`release`](release) | builds and publishes the Store catalog |
| `tools` | `oap_pack.js`, `oap_link.js`: pack the app |

## Install

In the Store, add the GitHub source `robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps` and install
**Waze on cluster**. The Store installs what it requires first: `mgu-deploy`
0.7.0 from mgu-store, then `cluster-render` and the Waze tool from here. One
head-unit start activates the CarPlay patch. The Store removes them again:
the app, then the tool, then the renderer.

## Build

```sh
make -C native/cluster-render test test-x86 target    # host tests; the unit's toolchain and binary (Docker)
make -C native/waze-on-cluster test test-x86 target
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_control.js
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_page.js
node release/test/release_test.js
node release/release.js check                         # reproducible artifacts
```

Each folder's README has the details; [`release/README.md`](release/README.md)
covers versions, the catalog and publishing.
