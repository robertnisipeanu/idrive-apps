# idrive-apps

Tools and apps for the iDrive 7 head unit (MGU) of a BMW, installed from the
[mgu Store](https://github.com/robertnisipeanu/mgu-store).

| Path | |
|---|---|
| [`native/cluster-render`](native/cluster-render) | the cluster renderer: one service that draws every app's layers on the instrument cluster and the HUD, on iDrive 7 and iDrive 8 |
| [`native/waze-on-cluster`](native/waze-on-cluster) | the CarPlay map (Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps), or Android Auto's, on the instrument cluster, drawn through cluster-render |
| [`apps/robertn_waze_cluster`](apps/robertn_waze_cluster) | the iDrive app for it: Patch and Remove patch for CarPlay and Android Auto, status, Logs |
| [`native/mindflow-hud`](native/mindflow-hud) | HUD map (prototype): a clean road map around the car on the head-up display, drawn through cluster-render |
| [`apps/robertn_hud_map`](apps/robertn_hud_map) | the iDrive app for it: settings, and the car position and turn guidance it reads from BMW navigation |
| [`release`](release) | builds and publishes the Store catalog |
| `tools` | `oap_pack.js`, `oap_link.js`: pack the app |

## The map on the HUD

The app's **Show on** chooses where the map shows: the instrument cluster (**Cluster**, the default), the head-up
display (**HUD (experimental)**) or both (**Cluster and HUD (experimental)**). With both, the HUD gets up to half the
upload bandwidth, only what it uses, so both stay smooth. HUD support was contributed by
[eroobeeroo](https://github.com/eroobeeroo) and [wesleyredhat](https://github.com/wesleyredhat). Photos from a 2021 X5
xDrive45e (G05); street names blurred.

*The HUD map while driving: the route, the next streets and the speed readout over the road. (The panel at the
bottom right, battery power and temperatures, is a separate app.)*

| Before: Waze's grey-blue night field on the HUD | After: the background made black, which a HUD shows as nothing |
|---|---|

- **Size** - a slider in 5 % steps from 30 % to 85 % of the HUD's width, the picture's shape kept. Standard is the
  fitted box, about 57 %.
- **Position** - **Move left / right / up / down**, 10 px a press, and **Centre**. The map moves at once and is held
  inside the HUD.
- **Made for a HUD** - the frames are scaled on the head unit to the size shown, at most 10 a second, the corners are
  rounded, and a night map's background is made black so only the roads, route and labels float in view (green,
  such as parks, is kept).
- **Gives way** - the map steps aside while the HUD's own media and list pop-ups show, and never replaces BMW's own
  HUD content.
- **Turned off after errors** - if the instrument cluster restarts right after the HUD map shows, twice, the HUD map
  stays off (`HUD map: Disabled after errors`) until the next cluster-render version or `cluster-render guard-reset`;
  the cluster's map keeps working.

On the cluster the map fills the central area:

## Install

In the Store, add the GitHub source `robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps` and install
**Waze on cluster**. The Store installs what it requires first: `mgu-deploy`
0.7.11 from mgu-store, then `cluster-render` and the Waze tool from here. One
head-unit start activates the CarPlay patch, and the Android Auto patch on a
car that supports it. The Store removes them again:
the app, then the tool, then the renderer.

## Build

```sh
make -C native/cluster-render test test-x86 target    # host tests; the unit's toolchain and binary (Docker)
make -C native/waze-on-cluster test test-x86 target
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_control.js
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_page.js
node apps/robertn_waze_cluster/tools/test_i18n.js
node release/test/release_test.js
node release/release.js check                         # reproducible artifacts
```

Each folder's README has the details; [`release/README.md`](release/README.md)
covers versions, the catalog and publishing.
