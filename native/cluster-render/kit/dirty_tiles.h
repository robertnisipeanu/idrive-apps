/* Which parts of a decoded frame differ visibly from what the map buffer
 * holds.
 *
 * The buffer holds an earlier frame. The new frame is compared with it tile
 * by tile; the plan lists the rectangles that differ visibly, and the
 * producer writes only those (the render service's video_layer.h), so a map
 * that stands still sends almost nothing and a frame identical to the shown
 * one sends nothing.
 *
 * Tiles are 64x64 pixels from the top-left; the last row and column are
 * partial. 64 is four H.264 macroblocks, so a changed macroblock dirties one
 * tile, and it divides the 1088-pixel map width into 17 columns. Runs of
 * adjacent written tiles in a tile row become one rectangle, and a run
 * directly below a rectangle of the same columns extends it, so a
 * full-width change is a single contiguous rectangle. Rectangles never take
 * in unchanged tiles: the bytes are what the link limits, and on the
 * emulator writes of 1 to 37 rectangles took the same time within noise. A
 * plan has at most 102 rectangles at 1088x720, each at least 1 KB.
 *
 * Noise filter. A still CarPlay map is not still in the decoded pixels: the
 * phone keeps coding residuals for macroblocks that did not change, and the
 * decoded values wander by a few levels. On a parked-car Waze capture from
 * this car (1920x900, 1338 frames) a third of the tiles differed from the
 * frame before, nearly all by at most 3 levels in any channel; 0.7% of them
 * by more than 8. A tile whose largest channel difference from what the
 * buffer holds is at most the threshold is quiet: it is left as shown. The
 * comparison is always against what the buffer holds, so a slow drift is
 * written once it adds up past the threshold, and after each plan is written
 * no shown pixel is more than the threshold off the frame it was planned
 * from. Frames the caller does not plan (upload_pacer.h holding them back)
 * are not shown at all until the next plan, which carries their changes. A
 * tile that has stayed quiet (but not equal) for settle_ms is written anyway,
 * so a small difference left at a seam with a written neighbour does not
 * stay. Threshold 0 writes every difference.
 *
 * When at least kWholePercent of the tiles are to be written (a pan, a zoom,
 * a keyframe), the plan is the whole frame instead: the tiles left out would
 * save at most a quarter of the bytes.
 *
 * One tile the size of the frame makes every plan nothing or the whole
 * frame. */
