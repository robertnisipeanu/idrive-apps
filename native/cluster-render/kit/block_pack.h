/* The map packed in 4x4 blocks, two colours each, for a persistent RGBA8
 * Texture2DBuffer (VideoConfig pan_blocks).
 *
 * The cluster takes no compressed texture format in a Texture2DBuffer
 * (createTexture2DBuffer refuses them), so the packing is our own, in an
 * ordinary RGBA8 buffer, unpacked by the fragment shader. Each 4x4 block of
 * the w x h picture is 8 bytes: two RGB565 endpoints c0 and c1 (bytes 0-1
 * and 2-3, little endian) and sixteen 2-bit selectors (bytes 4-7, one byte
 * a row, the left pixel in the low bits). A selector picks c0, c1,
 * (2 c0 + c1) / 3 or (c0 + 2 c1) / 3. The buffer is (w / 2) x (h / 4) RGBA8
 * texels: block (bx, by) is texels (2 bx, by), the endpoints, and
 * (2 bx + 1, by), the selectors; a 1088x480 map is 544x120, 261,120 B a
 * frame, a third of the R8 atlas.
 *
 * The packer reads the 4:2:0 atlas (yuv_atlas.h), turns it to RGB with the
 * atlas shader's own chroma siting and matrix (so the colours are what the
 * atlas path shows), and fits each block cheaply: the darkest and lightest
 * pixels as endpoints, the selectors by each pixel's place between them, one
 * least-squares refit of the endpoints for those selectors, the selectors
 * again. On the car's Waze capture that comes within 0.2 dB of a principal-
 * axis fit with two refits. */
