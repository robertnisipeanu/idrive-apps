/* The 4:2:0 atlas: a decoded frame's three planes in one 8-bit picture, so
 * one R8 texture carries the frame at 1.5 bytes a pixel and the map shader
 * turns it into colour on the cluster's GPU.
 *
 * For a w x h frame (both even) the atlas is w x atlas_height(h): rows 0 to
 * h-1 are the Y plane; rows h to h+h/2-1 hold the U plane in columns 0 to
 * w/2-1 and the V plane in columns w/2 to w-1. A 1088x480 frame is a
 * 1088x720 atlas, 783,360 B (RGB8: 1,566,720 B).
 *
 * Both renderers take R8 (VERIFIED, static): MGU's libramses maps public
 * ETextureFormat_R8 (1) to its internal R8 (1) (table 0x6a1620), and the
 * KOMBI's GL format switch (0x2e2130b) uploads internal R8 as
 * GL_R8 / GL_RED / GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE (case 0x2e21619).
 *
 * Colour. The phone's stream is full-range BT.601 (its SPS VUI:
 * video_full_range_flag 1, matrix_coefficients 6, no chroma location, so
 * type 0 — VERIFIED on the car's capture), so the shader converts full range
 * with the BT.601 matrix, its chroma samples left-sited horizontally and
 * centred vertically between luma rows (as decoded; a frame the decoder
 * scales is sited as VPP scales it). Each chroma plane is upsampled
 * bilinearly inside its own part of the atlas: the coordinates are clamped
 * half a texel in from the part's edges, so the filter never mixes U, V and
 * Y.
 *
 * atlas_rgb() is the shader on the CPU, coordinate for coordinate, for the
 * host test. */
