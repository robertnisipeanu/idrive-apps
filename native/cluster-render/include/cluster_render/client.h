 *       c.frame(map, &atlas, n);   // whenever a frame is decoded; atlas comes back free
 *   }
 *
 * Nothing blocks. The client connects, and reconnects whenever the service
 * goes (a restart, an update), making every asset and layer again with its
 * last settings: uniforms, mesh parts with their geometry and transforms,
 * binds and animations, and every scene file with its kept edits; on_ready()
 * then asks the app for its content.
 * Frames are newest-wins per layer: a video frame not yet sent is replaced
 * by the next, so a producer never queues behind the display. A video
 * layer's last frame is kept once sent (and over a reconnect), so a frame
 * whose picture is that one again goes as a repeat (a few bytes; one per
 * layer waits, and a whole frame queued after it drops it), or that frame
 * whole to a service that has not had it on this connection, refused the
 * layer, or takes no repeats; an image
 * layer or an asset is kept here whole, and what changed since it was last
 * sent goes as one update when the socket takes it (and the whole of it
 * again after a reconnect). Control messages, geometry included, keep their
 * order and go before frames. */
