/* Slot arbitration: when each display target's scene is published and shown
 * in its slot, for every client of the service at once (README.md
 * "Arbitration").
 *
 * A target (the cluster panel, the map area, the HUD) is one slot with one
 * scene; all of its clients' layers are drawn in that scene (stack.h). The
 * slot manager is told each tick whether any layer on the target wants it
 * shown, and keeps it so:
 *
 *   Idle --wanted--> Acquiring --shown--> Shown --not wanted--> Lingering
 *                        |                  ^ |                   |    |
 *                        |                  | +--lost--+   wanted |    | linger_ms
 *                        |                  +----------|----------+    v
 *                        +--refused/timeout--> Waiting <+            release --> Idle
 *
 * Acquiring and Shown go to Parked when the display parks the scene, and
 * Lingering is released (Idle); Parked goes to Shown when the display shows
 * it, to Waiting when it is lost, and is released when nothing wants it.
 *
 * - The slot is requested when at least one layer wants it and released only
 *   when none has for linger_ms, so clients coming and going, or one
 *   replacing another, never unmaps it: their layers change in the scene.
 * - The display never takes a slot from the content it shows: a map into a
 *   slot that shows other content is accepted and parked, invisible, and
 *   the oldest parked mapping is shown when the shown one goes (VERIFIED on
 *   the car). Parked keeps the target mapped and fetched, with no timeout,
 *   until the display shows it. A contending target whose slot shows the
 *   stock HMI's content and that takes over from the stock HMI
 *   (TargetSpec::take_over_stock) unmaps that content as the HMI
 *   (Port::take_over), at most once per kTakeOverMs[] step (the count
 *   starts over after kTakeOverResetMs shown, or a release), then waits to be
 *   shown; the HMI maps its content again, parked behind ours, so it comes
 *   back when ours goes.
 * - Waiting is a slot someone else holds, a refusal, no answer, or a loss
 *   whose cause waits for the next table report (kVerdictMs). Who holds
 *   it comes from the display's slot table, one row per mapping: the row
 *   shown (map status foreground or background) is the holder, content of
 *   the stock HMI (scene ids 0x0100xxxx that are not ours), or of anything
 *   else (an app that does not use this service). Content of anything else
 *   is always yielded to: the slot is asked for again only once it is
 *   reported free. The stock HMI's is yielded to the same way unless a
 *   wanting layer contends; a contending target retries after 2, 5, 10, 20,
 *   then every 30 s, and the ladder starts over after 30 s shown. Any other
 *   refusal or no answer retries on the same ladder. A target waiting on
 *   the ladder whose slot the table reports disabled or with another
 *   content mapped, and then free again (a door-open warning come and
 *   gone), is asked for at once.
 * - Requests to a slot are spaced by at least kMinRequestGapMs, and one
 *   request is outstanding per slot. After a release, the next request of
 *   the scene waits until the display confirms the release
 *   (Port::confirmed) and, when subscriptions are observable, the renderer
 *   has unsubscribed from the scene (in the emulator about 150 ms after the
 *   display's confirmation), at most kConfirmMs. A fetch the display fails within
 *   kFreshSceneMs of the scene's publication (its renderer not having seen
 *   the publication yet) is asked again after kFreshRetryMs, up to
 *   kFreshRetries times; then the ladder.
 * - A shown scene the display removes (no other content in the slot, the
 *   slot not locked, not our release) is asked for again no sooner than
 *   kRemovalWaitMs after the removal, or the ladder's step if longer: on the
 *   car the KOMBI failed the fetch 2 s after such a removal and took it
 *   7 s after. A fetch that fails within kNotReadyMs of a request made
 *   within kNotReadyWindowMs of the removal is the display not ready yet:
 *   asked again after kNotReadyRetryMs, up to kNotReadyRetries times; then
 *   the ladder.
 * - Warm scenes: a target's scene is published at its first request and
 *   stays published while the target is released, lost, refused or timed
 *   out; only the display's fetch and map cycle. A released target stages
 *   and flushes nothing. The scene goes only when another target needs its
 *   scene id: two targets with one scene id cannot both be requested (the
 *   second waits until the first is released), and the second's request
 *   takes the first's scene down before it publishes its own.
 * - The display service going away takes every target down; when it comes
 *   back, the targets still wanted are requested again after kSettleMs. The
 *   scenes stay published: RAMSES publication does not go through Dcsm2,
 *   and a renderer that subscribes gets the scene as it was last flushed.
 * - Rendering: the display's renderer subscribes to a scene it is to draw,
 *   which the RAMSES client logs (ramses_console.h). A target the display
 *   shows counts as rendered once its renderer is subscribed to its scene.
 *   Once any subscription has been seen in this process, a shown target
 *   whose scene is not subscribed kVerifyMs after the display showed it
 *   (or after the renderer unsubscribed) is released and asked for again,
 *   at once the first time and on the ladder after that, with its scene
 *   kept. Before any subscription has been seen nothing is verified.
 *
 * Everything here is host-testable: the display's placement service (Port)
 * and the scenes (Scenes) are interfaces. */
