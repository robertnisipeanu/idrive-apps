/* A client's layer on a target, and the two simple kinds: image (RGBA
 * pixels a client draws, written in changed rectangles into one persistent
 * buffer) and effect (a client's fragment shader over a quad, driven by
 * uniforms). The video kind is video_layer.h, the mesh kind mesh_layer.h.
 *
 * A layer outlives its target's scene: it keeps what it shows on the CPU,
 * so when the scene is published again (attach) it is drawn as it was, its
 * animations started again. Each render tick the compositor asks every
 * layer of a requested target to stage its changes into the scene, flushes
 * the scene once if any did, and tells each layer whether that flush went
 * (committed). A layer that staged nothing is not asked. A layer whose
 * failed write left its buffer half written either holds the target until
 * its whole rewrite goes (holds_flush) or is hidden until then. No
 * layer makes a texture, sampler or effect per update. */
