/* The iDrive 7 display port: the KOMBI's Dcsm2 service
 * (../dcsm/DCSM.md), for any number of targets at once.
 *
 * A request is a fetch of the target's scene and, once FETCHED, a map into
 * its slot with its content class; MAPPED_FOREGROUND or MAPPED_BACKGROUND
 * (the under-the-gauges layer) is shown, MAPPED_INVISIBLE is parked behind
 * the content the slot shows. A release is an unmap, when a map was asked
 * for and not refused, then an unfetch. A take-over is an unmap of the
 * stock HMI's content sent with the HMI's client handle. The KOMBI names
 * only the scene id in its events, and its replies name nothing: each reply
 * is the answer to the oldest request of its kind still unanswered (SOME/IP
 * over TCP answers in order), so the scenes asked for are queued per kind
 * while Dcsm2 is available (vsomeip drops requests while it is not). Only
 * fetch and map replies decide anything; unmap replies, ours and the
 * take-overs', are matched in their own queue and logged.
 *
 * Seen from the slot manager (slots.h):
 * - a refused fetch or map, or FETCH FAILED, is a refusal: PRIOTOOLOW and
 *   ALREADYMAPPED say the slot is busy, an unknown slot, scene or client is
 *   the configuration, FETCH FAILED is its own, the rest (no valid reply,
 *   the fetch removed before it showed) is transient;
 * - a mapped scene the KOMBI maps invisible is parked; parked, then shown,
 *   is shown;
 * - a shown or parked scene the KOMBI unmaps or whose fetch it removes is
 *   lost (the stock map re-mapping over ours removes our fetch with no map
 *   transition, seen on the car; a locked slot unmaps every mapping in it);
 * - Dcsm2 going away loses every scene at once;
 * - the REMOVED that answers our own unfetch is not a loss, even when the
 *   same scene id was asked for again since (panel and HUD share one);
 * - a release is confirmed once the replies to its unfetch (matched in a
 *   queue of their own) have come and, when the content was fetched, the
 *   REMOVED that answers it, or a reply saying the unfetch failed, after
 *   which none comes. Seen on the car: the unmap's reply, the unfetch's,
 *   then REMOVED, within about 35 ms.
 *
 * For the field logs it counts what the KOMBI sends (fetch, map and slot
 * events, notifications that did not decode, replies), logs undecoded
 * notifications (at most every kUndecodedLogMs per event id) and each change
 * of the subscription's answer, and, when the slot manager gives up on a
 * request, what arrived since it and the last slot table. The counts, the
 * availability and the subscription go in the service's status text.
 *
 * All of it runs on the render thread: Dcsm2Link queues what vsomeip's
 * thread receives and hands it over in order (dcsm2_link.h). */
