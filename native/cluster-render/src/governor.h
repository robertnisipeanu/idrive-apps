/* The upload governor: the one byte budget every client's writes share
 * (upload_pacer.h), steered by what the link to the display shows
 * (README.md "Upload budget").
 *
 * The cap starts at the ceiling (upload_kb_per_s, 5500 KB/s). Evidence of
 * the link falling behind the writes scores points in a sliding window, but
 * only while writes go (within kActiveMs of activity(), which the
 * compositor reports from 64 KB a second written); at other times it is
 * logged, not counted:
 *
 *   a shown scene removed by the display, not by the stock HMI    6
 *   heartbeat replies silent (the link stalled)                    3
 *   a flush or a setData refused                                   2
 *   a flush that took longer than slow_flush_ms                    1
 *
 * A slot request refused or not answered is arbitration, not bandwidth: the
 * slot manager retries it and the cap does not move.
 *
 * When the window (30 s) holds kThreshold points the cap steps down by
 * one step (500 KB/s), not below the floor (2000 KB/s), and the window
 * starts empty. A removal reaches the threshold alone: on the car the
 * KOMBI dropped a shown scene, with healthy heartbeats and no lock, after
 * the busiest minute of upload. No other single event does, so one
 * transient error never lowers the cap. After a step down, kCooldownMs pass
 * before the next one. The cap steps back up one step at a time, each after
 * recover_ms of healthy upload (nothing in the window while writes go;
 * idle time neither counts nor resets). A step down within kProbationMs
 * of a step up doubles recover_ms (to at most kRecoverMaxMs), so a level
 * that failed is tried less often; kSettledMs with no step down sets it
 * back to kRecoverMs. Down is quick and up is slow, so the cap does not
 * oscillate. */
