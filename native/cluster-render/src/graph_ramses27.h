/* The iDrive 8 renderer: graph.h on the unit's RAMSES 27 client library
 * (../abi/ABI27.md), whose scenes the cluster's renderer draws once the
 * cluster takes the content they are offered as (dcsm27_port.h).
 *
 * The scene is built as graph_ramses19.cpp builds it: a pixel-space
 * orthographic camera over the target, each quad a mesh node under two
 * nodes that place and turn it, each view a render pass of its own, the
 * passes in draw order (plan_passes), one real-time animation system per
 * scene. What RAMSES 27 changes:
 * - effects and array resources belong to a scene, not to the client. An
 *   effect is compiled once in a scratch scene that is never published (to
 *   check it and read its attributes) and again in each scene that draws
 *   it, at its first quad or part; dropped, it goes from every scene;
 * - texture buffers are written with updateData, the flush takes only a
 *   tag, visibility is a mode (hidden quads are Invisible: they keep their
 *   resources);
 * - no pass clears colour, the first one included: the cluster draws the
 *   scene into its own area (VERIFIED on the car with icwidget, whose
 *   moving text left no trail);
 * - a scene taken down while its content is offered, or its offer is
 *   stopping, stays published as it was last flushed until the cluster has
 *   accepted the stop (retired, then dropped by drop_retired()), as icwidget
 *   did on the car: unpublished at once, the stand-in cluster in the
 *   emulator logged errors unassigning it. No new scene with its id is built
 *   meanwhile: scene() refuses, and the target waits on the slot manager's
 *   ladder. A scene taken down with no offer left (a warm scene, slots.h)
 *   goes at once. */
