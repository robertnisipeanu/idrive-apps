/* A video layer: decoded 4:2:0 frames, such as a CarPlay map, drawn with
 * these upload rules:
 *
 * - one persistent R8 buffer holding the frame's Y, U and V planes as an
 *   atlas (yuv_atlas.h), turned into colour by the renderer's GPU, with one
 *   sampler, made when the scene is: no texture or sampler per frame;
 * - each update writes only the 64x64 tiles that differ visibly from what
 *   the buffer holds (the noise filter and settle time, dirty_tiles.h), the
 *   whole atlas when most do, in place with setData;
 * - fast motion whose exact write the byte budget cannot cover at once goes
 *   as 4x4 colour blocks into one of two persistent RGBA8 buffers drawn by a
 *   second quad (block_pack.h), and the exact atlas comes back with the next
 *   update the budget covers, or kRefineMs after the last packed one;
 * - updates go on the frame clock's grid (frame_clock.h) and within the
 *   service's one byte budget (upload_pacer.h), shared by every layer;
 * - only the newest frame waits: a frame not yet written is replaced by each
 *   newer one, so the picture skips ahead and memory stays four atlases, a
 *   rectangle scratch and, with packed blocks, the packing;
 * - setData and the flush are checked: on a refusal the newest frame stays
 *   pending and the next write is whole.
 *
 * The target's scene carries every layer, so stage() writes and the
 * compositor flushes once for all of them; committed() then settles the
 * flush's outcome: what it wrote is shown, or after a refusal the next write
 * is whole. Frames come from a client (offer). */
