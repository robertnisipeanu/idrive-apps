/* What the display's renderer does with our scenes, read from the RAMSES
 * client's own console log.
 *
 * RAMSES tells a client nothing about who subscribes to its scenes, but the
 * unit's libramses logs it on stdout at console level info, its default
 * (the service sets it through the framework's arguments all the same):
 *
 *   SceneGraphComponent::handleSceneSubscription: received scene subscription for scene 16778480 from
 *     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
 *   SceneGraphComponent::handleSceneUnsubscription:  received scene unsubscription for scene 16778480 from
 *     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
 *   SceneGraphComponent::participantHasDisconnected: unsubscribing all scenes for particpant:
 *     00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
 *   ResourceComponent::handleRequestResources(from 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001): send locally
 *     available 4 resources: 0x166fdde1b42326269dd47178577c086f ... ;
 *
 * each one line after "<unix time> [ Info  ] ramses.Client        | ", the
 * time, level and context wrapped in colour codes; the (un)subscription of a
 * scene the client does not know says "for unknown scene" (VERIFIED in the
 * emulator with the car's libramses build, against its stand-in KOMBI
 * renderer). Scene ids print in decimal; 0x hex is read too.
 *
 * RamsesConsole moves fd 1 onto a pipe before any RAMSES object exists and
 * makes stdout line buffered, so each line reaches the pipe as it is
 * written; a thread reads it. RAMSES's own lines (a "ramses." context, or
 * one of the above) are dropped: at info they are several a second. Any
 * other line (another library's console log) goes on to the original stdout
 * unchanged. Of RAMSES's lines it keeps the parsed events, with the time
 * each was read, and, as raw text without colour codes, the first
 * kFirstLines that are not the 2-second statistics (ramses.Periodic), then
 * every line that mentions one of our scene ids or contains "ubscri" (not
 * the statistics), at most kRawPerMinute a minute, so field logs show the
 * exact formats even where the parser misses one. Every line read is counted
 * by its context ("other" for another library's), with the time of the
 * last, so the status shows whether the console stays alive while no
 * subscription line comes.
 * fd() is readable while something waits to be taken. If the pipe cannot be
 * set up, stdout is left as it was and nothing is ever read; if reading it
 * fails, the original stdout goes back onto fd 1 (so RAMSES never blocks on
 * a full pipe) and nothing more is read. It lives for the process: made
 * once, never destroyed. */
