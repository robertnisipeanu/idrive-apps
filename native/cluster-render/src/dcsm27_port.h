/* The iDrive 8 display port: the DcsmProvider built into the unit's RAMSES
 * 27, whose consumer is the cluster (over SOME/IP RemoteContentManager
 * 0xB0A3), for any number of targets at once (README.md "iDrive 8").
 *
 * A target's slot is a DCSM category and TargetSpec::content the content
 * offered in it, as the target's scene. The cluster decides when to show
 * it: some categories by themselves (the cluster's middle, the HUD), the
 * widget once it is picked in the cluster's widget menu (VERIFIED on the
 * car). So:
 * - a request is an offer. Accepted, the target is parked: offered, not
 *   shown, with no timeout, as a Dcsm2 map the KOMBI parks. Refused, it is
 *   a transient refusal (the ladder): the library says only that it could
 *   not offer, and another provider offering the same content is the one
 *   cause a valid configuration leaves;
 * - the cluster asking for the content (contentReadyRequested) is answered
 *   at once: the scene is published before the offer;
 * - contentShow is shown; contentHide and contentRelease (the cluster takes
 *   the content back to Ready, Assigned or Offered, as on every layout
 *   change, VERIFIED on the car) are parked again: the offer stays;
 * - a release is a stop of the offer, confirmed() once the cluster accepts
 *   it (on the car within about 30 ms). Until then the library refuses a new
 *   offer of the content (even from inside stopOfferAccepted: it forgets the
 *   content only after that returns): the slot manager waits for the
 *   confirmation, and a request that comes anyway is refused (the ladder).
 *   The scene stays published meanwhile, warm (slots.h) or, taken down,
 *   retired until on_stopped (Ramses27Gpu::scene builds no new one with its
 *   id);
 * - nothing is lost while the offer stands: a cluster that goes away takes
 *   its assignments back (contentRelease), and the offer is there when it
 *   comes back. There is no slot table, no take-over (no counterpart is
 *   known) and no heartbeat.
 *
 * All of it runs on the render thread: the unit's loop dispatches the
 * provider's events (unit_idrive8.cpp), and dispatch() delivers what a
 * request decided once the slot manager has taken the request's state. */
