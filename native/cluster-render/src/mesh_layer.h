/* A mesh layer: a client's 3D content, drawn in its own render pass over
 * params.rect with its own camera, at its place in the layer stack.
 *
 * It holds parts, each drawn by the client's shaders (part effect) with
 * geometry the client sends: immutable resources made once a geometry, not
 * per frame. A part's geometry may be replaced at most once a second; its
 * bytes spend the shared upload budget. Parts move by their pose, and by
 * animations the renderer plays itself; uniforms and asset binds are per
 * part. Everything is kept on the CPU, so a new scene gets it all again.
 * The layer is ready once a part has geometry. */
