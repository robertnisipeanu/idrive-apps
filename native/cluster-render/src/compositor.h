/* The compositor: every client's layers in their targets' scenes.
 *
 * Each tick, arrange() orders each target's layers (stack.h), shows the
 * drawn ones in its scene and tells the slot manager whether the target is
 * wanted; render() then has every layer of each requested target stage its
 * changes, top layer first (so overlays get the byte budget before a video
 * under them), and flushes the scene once: a tick's changes of all layers
 * reach the display together or not at all. A setData a layer could not
 * finish holds the flush back for the tick, and every layer that staged is
 * told the flush did not go (layer.h). A video layer or an exclusive image
 * whose buffer that left half written holds the target from then on: only
 * its whole rewrite stages, when the budget allows, and nothing is flushed
 * until it goes, so the display keeps the last frame.
 *
 * Assets (asset.h) are staged before the layers, in the same flush. A layer
 * that samples an asset (bind) is ready once every asset it samples has
 * pixels, and drawn only while their buffers hold them whole.
 *
 * Fades: a target's video and image layers are drawn at their opacity times
 * the target's fade. The fade is 0 while the target is not on screen
 * (acquiring, parked), rises to 1 over fade_ms once it is shown, and, when
 * nothing wants the target any more, falls back to 0 over fade_ms with the
 * layers last drawn kept drawn and the target kept wanted, so it is released
 * after the fade. A fade step goes at most every kFadeStepMs, in the
 * target's ordinary flush. A parked target stages nothing: nothing of it is
 * on screen.
 *
 * It is the slot manager's Scenes: publishing a target builds its scene and
 * attaches the target's assets and then its layers, which start from what
 * they last showed, binds and animations included; unpublishing takes the
 * scene down and keeps the assets and the layers. Only a target the slot
 * manager has requested stages and flushes. A released target's scene stays
 * published as last flushed, its layers attached and holding what they have
 * not written: a video's newest frame, an image's changed rectangles. Asked
 * for again, its layers continue from there in the tick that asks: what
 * their buffers hold is what the scene last flushed, and a renderer that
 * subscribes gets the scene whole, as last flushed, from the RAMSES client
 * (VERIFIED on a test unit: sent at the subscription), so a video writes
 * the tiles that differ from it, not the whole frame. That resend is
 * charged to the byte budget when the display takes the scene (resent()).
 *
 * The layers and assets of a target with the HUD's share (TargetSpec::share)
 * write from a budget of their own (upload_pacer.h share_of): while one of
 * them is asked for and has a layer, up to kSharePct of each refill of the
 * budget, only as much as they spend, what they leave going back to the
 * other targets at once, and the whole refill while the other targets'
 * budget sits full. The two together never hold more than one burst. The
 * other targets never get less than the rest, and with no such layer they
 * go exactly as they would without it. Evidence from such a target is
 * logged, never counted towards the cap, and its bytes are not the link's
 * load for the governor, so it never moves the cap.
 *
 * Videos: each video layer keeps buffers on the display (video_layer.h),
 * whose memory nobody has measured, so the display holds at most
 * CompositorLimits::videos of them, however many video layers the clients
 * have. While the display can hold every video's buffers, each video draws
 * itself, exactly as with no composites at all. Past that, the videos on
 * one target drawn unturned, at their frame's size and at even x and y are
 * drawn through the target's composite (video_composite.h): one video
 * layer composed on the CPU, one set of buffers, one video in the byte
 * budget and the dirty-tile planner; the targets whose composite saves the
 * most buffers compose, as few as it takes. A video turned, scaled or at an
 * odd x or y keeps buffers of its own. A video joining or leaving a
 * composite, and a composite made
 * again, start their scene objects again: their first frame goes whole. A
 * composite is made again for its videos' rectangle growing past it at most
 * every kRemakeMs (till then what lies outside is cut), and smaller only
 * once the smaller rectangle has held for kShrinkMs. A video starts or stops
 * being composited by a change of its params (an odd x, a turn) at most
 * kRemakeMs after its target's last such change; till then it keeps its
 * mode, a composited one drawn unturned at its frame's size and at even x
 * and y. A change is taken only when the videos fit the display both while
 * it is held and once it is real; and reconcile() never changes a buffer
 * for videos that do not fit, whatever let them in. On a target, old objects
 * go before new ones are made, in the same flush. Each target's scene reaches
 * the display with its own flush, so a target whose videos need more buffers
 * keeps them as they are until the other targets' scenes, as flushed, leave
 * room. The display never holds more video buffers than the limit.
 *
 * Hidden tiles: each tick, before a requested target stages, its layers are
 * told from the top down what the layers drawn above them cover opaquely in
 * the next flush (occlusion.h), so each video, and the composite, leaves
 * the tiles wholly under that unwritten (video_layer.h). Only a layer drawn
 * strictly above another in the draw order covers it: of layers at one
 * place in it the renderer chooses the order. A target with no video, or
 * nothing drawn above its lowest, has nothing hidden and no walk.
 *
 * A video whose unwritten tiles a change uncovers (a layer above moved,
 * hidden, turned, made translucent, faded, animated or gone, or the video
 * itself moved or shown) writes them in the flush that carries the change,
 * whatever its frame clock. Its target stages first in the tick, so that
 * write takes the next positive allowance before other targets' writes; so
 * does a target whose alert or exclusive layer waits for its first write
 * (an exclusive layer suspends the layers below it only from the tick
 * after that write went: stack.h).
 *
 * While the budget does not allow it, only that change waits
 * (defer_uncover): the layer it concerns keeps in the scene what the last
 * flush that went showed of it (rect, turn, opacity, drawn, draw order, its
 * animations not started yet), the fade its last flushed step, the
 * composite's sources their quads' places and opacity. The changes wait in
 * units: an exclusive layer coming or going waits with the layers it
 * suspends or resumes, and a layer moved or hidden off a place where a
 * waiting layer is to be drawn waits with it, so no flush shows a state
 * that neither the client's nor the last flush's is. Everything else on the
 * target stages and flushes as usual, and a layer waiting touches the scene
 * only when it is held or released; a held layer's fade applies to its last
 * flushed opacity. The wait is the time the budget takes to repay what it
 * owes, and at most one write of another target that has waited longer:
 * targets with tiles to uncover, or an alert's first write, stage
 * longest-waiting first. A target's wait
 * starts at the first tick what its client set uncovers tiles and lasts,
 * however often the target flushes its other changes meanwhile, until the
 * flush carrying the uncovering write goes. A held layer that becomes a
 * composite's source is held no more: the composite's own deferred moves
 * place it. An image's
 * pixels waiting to be written count for coverage only while the budget
 * allows the image's write, so pixels turning transparent never uncover
 * before they can show.
 *
 * Changes that cannot wait so go at once: a layer removed (with what an
 * exclusive one resumes), an image hidden after a failed write, video
 * objects made again (a composite made or
 * dropped, a video leaving or joining one), and a composited video hidden
 * or put at another place in the draw order (its quads change at once). A
 * video they uncover writes in that flush whatever the budget allows,
 * hiding nothing: with packed blocks the newest frame packed (at most one
 * packed frame, about a third of an exact one, past the budget's debt; the
 * exact atlas comes back with a write the budget allows), without them
 * every changed tile; when none of the tiles it uncovers differs from its
 * newest frame past the threshold, nothing. It then hides no tile until a
 * write the budget
 * allowed has gone (so the debt was repaid), so such writes never come one
 * after the other.
 *
 * A target with no video, or nothing drawn above its lowest one, and
 * nothing hidden, held or waiting, does no occlusion work in a tick beyond
 * a check of what arrange() found.
 *
 * Scene contents (PROTOCOL.md "Scene files"): a client's scene file on a
 * target, at most one a target. While one is there and has not failed to
 * load, the target is wanted, its scene is the file's (Gpu::load), and every
 * layer on it waits with reason "scene", as below an exclusive layer. The
 * content's edits (scene_edit.h) stage in the target's one flush a tick; a
 * scene loaded again gets them all again. When the content comes or goes,
 * the published scene is stale (Scenes::stale) and the slot manager
 * publishes the target again: at once while something wants it, else after
 * the linger, when it is released. A content's file replaced, its scene is
 * outdated (Scenes::outdated) and published again in place, the target
 * kept in its slot. The files' sizes are charged to the
 * budget when the scene is published and when the display takes it again:
 * the renderer fetches its resources then.
 *
 * A content with layers (SceneLayers) has the target's layers drawn over its
 * file: the target's graph is FileScene::layers(), in the file's own scene,
 * and the layers are arranged, staged and flushed as on any target, the
 * content's due edits in the same flush. Without that graph (the backend
 * draws none) they wait as without layers. A content may host other targets
 * (Host): the service only keeps that and tells every client (server.h);
 * the hosted target's producers act on it. */
