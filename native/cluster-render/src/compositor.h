/* The compositor: every client's layers in their targets' scenes.
 *
 * Each tick, arrange() orders each target's layers (stack.h), shows the
 * drawn ones in its scene and tells the slot manager whether the target is
 * wanted; render() then has every layer of each requested target stage its
 * changes, top layer first (so overlays get the byte budget before a video
 * under them), and flushes the scene once: a tick's changes of all layers
 * reach the display together or not at all. A setData a layer could not
 * finish holds the flush back for the tick, and every layer that staged is
 * told the flush did not go (layer.h). A video layer or an exclusive image
 * whose buffer that left half written holds the target from then on: only
 * its whole rewrite stages, when the budget allows, and nothing is flushed
 * until it goes, so the display keeps the last frame.
 *
 * Assets (asset.h) are staged before the layers, in the same flush. A layer
 * that samples an asset (bind) is ready once every asset it samples has
 * pixels, and drawn only while their buffers hold them whole.
 *
 * Fades: a target's video and image layers are drawn at their opacity times
 * the target's fade. The fade is 0 while the target is not on screen
 * (acquiring, parked), rises to 1 over fade_ms once it is shown, and, when
 * nothing wants the target any more, falls back to 0 over fade_ms with the
 * layers last drawn kept drawn and the target kept wanted, so it is released
 * after the fade. A fade step goes at most every kFadeStepMs, in the
 * target's ordinary flush. A parked target stages nothing: nothing of it is
 * on screen.
 *
 * It is the slot manager's Scenes: publishing a target builds its scene and
 * attaches the target's assets and then its layers, which start from what
 * they last showed, binds and animations included; unpublishing takes the
 * scene down and keeps the assets and the layers. Only a target the slot
 * manager has requested stages and flushes. A released target's scene stays
 * published as last flushed, its layers attached and holding what they have
 * not written: a video's newest frame, an image's changed rectangles. Asked
 * for again, its layers continue from there in the tick that asks: what
 * their buffers hold is what the scene last flushed, and a renderer that
 * subscribes gets the scene whole, as last flushed, from the RAMSES client
 * (VERIFIED in the emulator: sent at the subscription), so a video writes
 * the tiles that differ from it, not the whole frame. That resend is
 * charged to the byte budget when the scene is asked for (resent()). */
