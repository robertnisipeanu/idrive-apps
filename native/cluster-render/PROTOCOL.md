# cluster-render protocol, version 1

A client connects to the service's stream socket
(`/dev/shm/cluster-render/render.sock`, group `tm_oap_app`). Messages go
both ways, each:

```
u32 length (little-endian: the bytes after it) | u8 type | body
```

| Type | Body |
|---|---|
| `J` (0x4A) | a flat JSON object: string and number values (true/false count as 1/0) |
| `F` (0x46) | `u32 ref, u64 frame id, u16 rect count, rect count x {u16 x, y, w, h}, pixels` (little-endian) |
| `M` (0x4D) | a mesh part's geometry ([below](#mesh-geometry-m)) |

A message is at most 5,529,664 bytes (a whole 1920x720 RGBA image). The C++
client is `include/cluster_render/client.h`, the Node 8 client
`js/cluster_render_client.js`; both reconnect by themselves and make their
assets and layers again, with their pixels, uniforms, parts and geometry,
binds and animations.

## Client to service

Every JSON message has `op`. A client names its layers and assets with its
own `ref` (a positive number, unique within its connection across both);
they go when the connection does, the layers before the assets.

| op | Fields |
|---|---|
| `hello` | `app` (a name for the logs), `proto` 1 |
| `layer` | `ref`, `target`, `kind` (`video`, `image`, `effect`, `mesh`), the layer fields, and the kind's fields |
| `asset` | `ref`, `target`, `format` (`rgba8` default, `r8`), `w`, `h` (1-2048, within one frame message), `sampling` (`nearest` default, `bilinear`), `wrap` (`clamp` default, `repeat`) |
| `set` | `ref` and any layer field; for a mesh layer also its camera and projection fields (not `projection` itself) |
| `uniform` | `ref`, `name`, `v`, optional `type`, `part` ([below](#uniforms)); effect layers and mesh parts |
| `bind` | `ref` (an effect or mesh layer), `part` (a mesh layer's), `sampler` (the shader's `sampler2D`), `asset` (an asset's ref on the same target); binds again when sent again |
| `part` | `ref` (a mesh layer), `part` (1 or more), `vs`, `fs`, `depth` (1 default: tested less-or-equal and written; 0), `cull` (`back` default, `front`, `none`), `blend` (`alpha` default, `add`, `none`) |
| `transform` | `ref`, `part`, any of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz` (degrees, right-handed), `sx`, `sy`, `sz` |
| `animate` | `ref`, `part`, `anim`, `property`, `name`, `keys`, `loop`, `interp` ([below](#animations)) |
| `stop` | `ref`, `anim` |
| `drop` | `ref`: a layer, or an asset no layer samples (else refused: `asset in use`) |
| `status` | — (answered by a `status` event) |

Layer fields (all optional):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `class` | `content` | `ambient`, `content`, `overlay` or `alert`: the stack's order, bottom to top |
| `z` | 0 | order within the class (-1000 to 1000); the newer layer is on top on a tie |
| `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` | the whole target | where the layer is drawn, in the target's pixels from its top-left |
| `visible` | 1 | 0 hides it; a target no visible layer wants is released after its linger |
| `exclusive` | 0 | 1 hides every layer below it while it is drawn |
| `prewarm` | 0 | 1 asks for the slot before the layer's first content |
| `contend` | 0 | 1 retries the slot after the stock HMI takes it (2, 5, 10, 20, then every 30 s), and on a target that takes over from the stock HMI (`map`), takes it from the stock content; 0 waits until it is free |
| `opacity` | 1 | 0-1, for video and image layers; drawn times the target's fade in and out |
| `rotate` | 0 | video, image and effect layers: degrees clockwise about the pivot |
| `sx`, `sy` | 1 | video, image and effect layers: scale about the pivot |
| `px`, `py` | the rect's centre | the pivot, in pixels from the rect's top-left; once set, kept until set again |

Kind fields:

| Kind | Field | Default | |
|---|---|---|---|
| video | `vw`, `vh` | 1088, 480 | the frame size; width a multiple of 4, height even, up to 1920x720 |
| | `fps` | 30 | updates a second at most (0: no clock) |
| | `level_bits` | 2 | low bits of each level rounded away (0-3) |
| | `dirty_threshold` | 8 | tiles differing by at most this many levels are not written (0-64) |
| | `settle_ms` | 1000 | such a tile is written after this long anyway (0: never) |
| | `pan_blocks` | 1 | fast motion as packed 4x4 blocks |
| | `stall_ms` | 6000 | no frame for this long: the layer is stalled (not drawn) |
| image | `iw`, `ih` | the rect | the image size, up to 1920x720 |
| | `fps` | 30 | writes a second at most |
| | `sampling` | `nearest` | or `bilinear` (a rect of another size than the image) |
| effect | `fs` | — | the fragment shader, GLSL ES 1.00, with `varying vec2 v_uv` (0,0 at the top-left) |
| | `vs` | the service's | a vertex shader with `attribute vec2 a_position` and `uniform mat4 u_mvp` |
| | `time_fps` | 0 | `u_time` (seconds since the layer was made) updated this often |
| | `time` | 0 | 1: `u_time` from the renderer's own clock, seconds from 0 to 3600 and again, nothing sent per frame (declare it `highp`); excludes `time_fps` |
| mesh | `projection` | `perspective` | or `ortho`; set when the layer is made |
| | `fov` | 30 | perspective: the vertical field of view, degrees (1-179) |
| | `ortho_h` | 2 | ortho: the height seen, in scene units |
| | `near`, `far` | 0.1, 100 | the clip planes |
| | `cx`, `cy`, `cz` | 0, 0, 0 | the camera's position; it looks down its -z |
| | `crx`, `cry`, `crz` | 0, 0, 0 | the camera's rotation, degrees, right-handed |

A mesh layer is drawn in a render pass of its own over its rect, at its
place in the stack, with the rect's aspect; a rect reaching past the target
is cut, not squeezed. It is ready once a part has geometry. Its passes clear
depth, never colour: the layers below it show.

Frames (`F`):
- **video**: no rects, and the whole 4:2:0 atlas: Y (w x h), then U and V
  side by side (w/2 each) in h/2 rows; `w * h * 3/2` bytes. Each frame
  replaces the layer's frame not yet written.
- **image**: RGBA rows, straight alpha. With rects, each rect's rows packed
  one rect after another; with none, the whole image.
- **asset**: the same, RGBA or one byte a pixel (`r8`).

An asset is not drawn and never makes its target wanted. The service keeps
its pixels, writes them whole into each new scene of its target and in place
as they change, before the layers, within the shared upload budget. A layer
that samples an asset is stalled until the asset has pixels, and waits while
the asset's buffer does not hold them whole.

### Shaders

GLSL ES 1.00. The renderer fills these uniforms wherever a shader declares
them, so in every shader they are reserved for it and must be mat4:
`u_mvp`, `u_mv`, `u_m`, `u_v`, `u_p` (model-view-projection, model-view,
model, view, projection) and `u_normal` (the inverse transpose of `u_mv`).
A part's vertex shader reads `attribute vec3 a_position` and any of
`vec3 a_normal`, `vec2 a_texcoord`, `vec4 a_color`; its geometry must carry
every attribute it reads.

### Uniforms

Without `type`, `v` is 1 to 4 numbers separated by spaces: a float, vec2,
vec3 or vec4. With `type` (`float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `mat4`), `v` is
up to 1024 finite numbers, whole elements of the type: one value, or an
array uniform of that many elements (a mat4 is 16 numbers in GLSL's column
order). `part` names a mesh layer's part; an effect layer has none. A quad
or part holds at most 32 uniforms and 4096 numbers. A name the shader does
not have is dropped.

### Mesh geometry (`M`)

```
u32 ref | u32 part | u32 vertices | u32 indices | u8 mask |
f32 positions (xyz per vertex) |
[f32 normals (xyz)]    mask 1
[f32 texcoords (uv)]   mask 2
[f32 colors (rgba)]    mask 4
u16 indices (triangles)
```

All little-endian. 1 to 65535 vertices; 3 to 196605 indices, whole
triangles, each less than the vertex count; every value finite; the body at
most 4 MiB and exactly this long. Anything else is refused with an `error`
event (`op` `mesh`). The geometry becomes immutable resources in the
renderer: a part's geometry may be replaced, at most once a second, and its
bytes spend the shared upload budget.

### Animations

The renderer plays an animation by itself; nothing is sent per frame. `anim`
is the client's number for it (1 or more), unique within the layer: sending
it again replaces it, `stop` ends it and its property goes back to what the
client set. A layer plays at most 16.

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `part` | a mesh layer's part; absent: the layer's quad, or a mesh layer's camera |
| `property` | `rotate`, `translate`, `scale` or `uniform` |
| `name` | the uniform's name (`property` `uniform`) |
| `keys` | `t:v[,v,v,v] t:v ...`: `t` in ms from the start, ascending; every key the same number of values; at most 256 keys |
| `loop` | 1: from the first key again after the last; 0 (default): holds the last |
| `interp` | `linear` (default) or `step` |

Values a key takes:

| On | `rotate` | `translate` | `scale` | `uniform` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| an image or effect layer | 1: degrees clockwise about the pivot | 3: pixels right, down, out from its place | 3 | 1, 3 or 4: float, vec3, vec4 |
| a mesh part | 3: degrees about x, y, z, right-handed | 3 | 3 | 1, 3 or 4 |
| a mesh layer's camera | 3 | 3 | — | — |

Animations are kept, and start again when a scene is published again.

## Service to client

Every JSON message has `ev`.

| ev | Fields | When |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `proto`, `backend` (`id7`, or `id8` on iDrive 8), `targets` (`map:1088x480,panel:1920x720,hud:800x480`; on iDrive 8 `map:874x749,hud:353x203,widget:2240x896`) | after the client's hello |
| `layer` | `ref`, `state`, `reason` | the layer's state changed |
| `target` | `target`, `state`, `holder`, `reason`, `retry_in_ms`, `rendering` | a target's state changed |
| `budget` | `cap_kb_per_s`, `max_kb_per_s`, `floor_kb_per_s`, `reason` | the upload cap changed |
| `error` | `op`, `ref`, `reason` | a message was refused |
| `status` | `text` | after a status request |

Layer states: `shown`; `waiting` (its target is not shown yet or is taken,
or an asset it samples is not written yet; `reason` says which);
`suspended` (below an exclusive layer); `stalled` (no content yet: no frame,
no part with geometry, an asset it samples without pixels; or a video's
frames stopped); `hidden`; `error` (the renderer refused it). Target states:
`idle`, `acquiring`, `parked` (mapped, behind the content the slot shows:
`holder` `stock` or `foreign` once the slot table names it, and `reason`
`parked behind stock`, `parked behind foreign`, or `parked` until then; on
iDrive 8: offered, until the cluster shows it), `shown`, `lingering`,
`waiting` (with `holder` `stock` or `foreign` when
someone else holds the slot, and `retry_in_ms` when on a timer),
`unavailable`. `rendering`, for a shown or lingering target: `verified`
(the display's renderer is subscribed to its scene), `checking` (not
subscribed yet; after 1.5 s shown the service asks for the slot again),
`unobservable` (the service cannot see subscriptions); `none` otherwise.

A client that does not read its events (over 1 MiB waiting) is
disconnected.
