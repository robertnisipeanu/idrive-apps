# cluster-render protocol, version 1

A client connects to the service's stream socket
(`/dev/shm/cluster-render/render.sock`, group `tm_oap_app`). Messages go
both ways, each:

```
u32 length (little-endian: the bytes after it) | u8 type | body
```

| Type | Body |
|---|---|
| `J` (0x4A) | a flat JSON object: string and number values (true/false count as 1/0) |
| `F` (0x46) | `u32 ref, u64 frame id, u16 rect count, rect count x {u16 x, y, w, h}, pixels` (little-endian) |
| `M` (0x4D) | a mesh part's geometry ([below](#mesh-geometry-m)) |

A message is at most 5,529,664 bytes (a whole 1920x720 RGBA image). The C++
client is `include/cluster_render/client.h`, the Node 8 client
`js/cluster_render_client.js`; both reconnect by themselves and make their
assets and layers again, with their pixels, uniforms, parts and geometry,
binds and animations.

## Client to service

Every JSON message has `op`. A client names its layers, scenes and assets
with its own `ref` (a positive number, unique within its connection across
all three); they go when the connection does, the layers before the assets. A field the
service does not know is ignored, so a client may send one an older service
lacks.

| op | Fields |
|---|---|
| `hello` | `app` (a name for the logs), `proto` 1 |
| `layer` | `ref`, `target`, `kind` (`video`, `image`, `effect`, `mesh`), the layer fields, and the kind's fields |
| `asset` | `ref`, `target`, `format` (`rgba8` default, `r8`, `etc2rgba`, `etc2rgb`: below), `w`, `h` (1-2048, within one frame message), `sampling` (`nearest` default, `bilinear`), `wrap` (`clamp` default, `repeat`) |
| `set` | `ref` and any layer field; for a mesh layer also its camera and projection fields (not `projection` itself) |
| `uniform` | `ref`, `name`, `v`, optional `type`, `part` ([below](#uniforms)); effect layers and mesh parts |
| `bind` | `ref` (an effect or mesh layer), `part` (a mesh layer's), `sampler` (the shader's `sampler2D`), `asset` (an asset's ref on the same target); binds again when sent again |
| `part` | `ref` (a mesh layer), `part` (1 or more), `vs`, `fs`, `depth` (1 default: tested less-or-equal and written; 0), `cull` (`back` default, `front`, `none`), `blend` (`alpha` default, `add`, `none`) |
| `transform` | `ref`, `part`, any of `tx`, `ty`, `tz`, `rx`, `ry`, `rz` (degrees, right-handed), `sx`, `sy`, `sz` |
| `animate` | `ref`, `part`, `anim`, `property`, `name`, `keys`, `loop`, `interp` ([below](#animations)) |
| `stop` | `ref`, `anim` |
| `scene` | `ref`, `target`, `file`, `res`, `sha256`, `contend` ([below](#scene-files)); sent again with its ref, another file in place |
| `edit` | `ref` (a scene), `lines` ([below](#scene-edits)) |
| `drop` | `ref`: a layer, a scene, or an asset no layer samples (else refused: `asset in use`) |
| `repeat` | `ref` (a video layer): a frame whose atlas is the layer's last frame's, byte for byte, in place of that frame; to a service whose hello has `repeat` 1 |
| `status` | — (answered by a `status` event) |

A client has at most 64 layers and all clients together 96 (past either, a
layer is refused with `too many layers`); a client has at most 16 assets,
all clients together 32 (past either: `too many assets`).

Video layers: all clients together have at most 8 (past it: `too many
video layers`), each within the service's 16 MB of pixel memory (past it:
`the service's pixel memory is full`). The display holds the buffers of at
most 2 videos. While that holds every video, each video has buffers of its
own. Past it, the videos on one target drawn unturned (`rotate` 0, `sx` and
`sy` 1), at their frame's size (`w` x `h` = `vw` x `vh`) and at even `x`
and `y` share one: the service composes them into one video on the head
unit, on as few targets as it takes. A turned, scaled or odd-placed video
always takes one of its own. A `layer` or a `set` that would need a third
is refused with `too many video buffers on the display`, and one whose
target's videos would have to share across more than 1920x720 with `the
target's videos together span more than 1920x720`. Videos that share keep
their place in the stack, rect and opacity. During their target's fade in
or out, overlapping videos are drawn as one picture faded together, not
each faded on its own; outside fades they look as drawn on their own,
unless another layer is between two overlapping translucent ones in the
stack. They are written as
one video: while any of them moves faster than the upload budget covers,
all of them go as packed 4x4 blocks. A shared video moved or shown again
appears at its new place with the write that puts its pixels there, never
before.
A target's videos starting or stopping sharing rewrites its video whole, as
does the shared video being made again: at most once a second for the
videos' rectangle growing past it (till then what lies outside is cut),
and smaller once their rectangle has stayed smaller for 3 s. A `set` that
makes a video start or stop sharing (an odd `x`, a turn) takes effect at
most once a second on its target; till then a sharing video is drawn
unturned, at its frame's size and at the even `x` and `y` at or left of and
above its own. Such a `set` is refused at once when the videos would not
fit once it takes effect.

Layer fields (all optional):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `class` | `content` | `ambient`, `content`, `overlay` or `alert`: the stack's order, bottom to top |
| `z` | 0 | order within the class (-1000 to 1000); the newer layer is on top on a tie |
| `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` | the whole target | where the layer is drawn, in the target's pixels from its top-left |
| `visible` | 1 | 0 hides it; a target no visible layer wants is released after its linger |
| `exclusive` | 0 | 1 hides every layer below it while it is drawn, once its first write has gone |
| `prewarm` | 0 | 1 asks for the slot before the layer's first content |
| `contend` | 0 | 1 retries the slot after the stock HMI takes it (2, 5, 10, 20, then every 30 s), and on a target that takes over from the stock HMI (`map`), takes it from the stock content; 0 waits until it is free |
| `guide_hold` | 1 | on a target guide holds follow (`map`, iDrive 7): 0 keeps them released while this layer wants the target, so the stock HMI's guidance box shows (README.md "Guide hold") |
| `yield` | 1 | on a target with yield slots (`hud`): 0 keeps the target shown over the stock HMI's pop-ups while this layer wants it (README.md "Giving way") |
| `opacity` | 1 | 0-1, for video and image layers; drawn times the target's fade in and out |
| `rotate` | 0 | video, image and effect layers: degrees clockwise about the pivot |
| `sx`, `sy` | 1 | video, image and effect layers: scale about the pivot |
| `px`, `py` | the rect's centre | the pivot, in pixels from the rect's top-left; once set, kept until set again |

Kind fields:

| Kind | Field | Default | |
|---|---|---|---|
| video | `vw`, `vh` | 1088, 480 | the frame size; width a multiple of 4, height even, up to 1920x720 |
| | `fps` | 30 | updates a second at most (0: no clock) |
| | `level_bits` | 2 | low bits of each level rounded away (0-3) |
| | `dirty_threshold` | 8 | tiles differing by at most this many levels are not written (0-64) |
| | `settle_ms` | 1000 | such a tile is written after this long anyway (0: never) |
| | `pan_blocks` | 1 | fast motion as packed 4x4 blocks |
| | `stall_ms` | 6000 | no frame for this long: the layer is stalled (not drawn) |
| image | `iw`, `ih` | the rect | the image size, up to 1920x720 |
| | `fps` | 30 | writes a second at most |
| | `sampling` | `nearest` | or `bilinear` (a rect of another size than the image) |
| effect | `fs` | — | the fragment shader, GLSL ES 1.00, with `varying vec2 v_uv` (0,0 at the top-left) |
| | `vs` | the service's | a vertex shader with `attribute vec2 a_position` and `uniform mat4 u_mvp` |
| | `time_fps` | 0 | `u_time` (seconds since the layer was made) updated this often |
| | `time` | 0 | 1: `u_time` from the renderer's own clock, seconds from 0 to 3600 and again, nothing sent per frame (declare it `highp`); excludes `time_fps` |
| mesh | `projection` | `perspective` | or `ortho`; set when the layer is made |
| | `fov` | 30 | perspective: the vertical field of view, degrees (1-179) |
| | `ortho_h` | 2 | ortho: the height seen, in scene units |
| | `near`, `far` | 0.1, 100 | the clip planes |
| | `cx`, `cy`, `cz` | 0, 0, 0 | the camera's position; it looks down its -z |
| | `crx`, `cry`, `crz` | 0, 0, 0 | the camera's rotation, degrees, right-handed |

A mesh layer is drawn in a render pass of its own over its rect, at its
place in the stack, with the rect's aspect; a rect reaching past the target
is cut, not squeezed. It is ready once a part has geometry. Its passes clear
depth, never colour: the layers below it show.

Frames (`F`):
- **video**: no rects, and the whole 4:2:0 atlas: Y (w x h), then U and V
  side by side (w/2 each) in h/2 rows; `w * h * 3/2` bytes. Each frame
  replaces the layer's frame not yet written. A `repeat` counts as a frame
  (it keeps the layer from stalling), with nothing to write; before the
  layer's first frame it does nothing.
- **image**: RGBA rows, straight alpha. With rects, each rect's rows packed
  one rect after another; with none, the whole image.
- **asset**: the same, RGBA or one byte a pixel (`r8`).
- **asset** `etc2rgba`, `etc2rgb`: no rects, and the whole texture once,
  `w` and `h` multiples of 4, blocks in rows top to bottom:
  - `etc2rgba`: ETC2 RGBA with EAC alpha (`GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA8_ETC2_EAC`),
    16 bytes a 4x4 block, each the alpha block then the colour block:
    `(w/4) * (h/4) * 16` bytes, a quarter of `rgba8`'s.
  - `etc2rgb`: opaque ETC2 RGB (`GL_COMPRESSED_RGB8_ETC2`), 8 bytes a 4x4
    block: `(w/4) * (h/4) * 8` bytes, an eighth of `rgba8`'s. Every pixel is
    drawn with alpha 1.

  A second frame is refused (`an etc2rgba asset is sent once`, or `etc2rgb`). Charged
  once to the pixel memory (no rectangle scratch). If the renderer refuses
  its texture, every layer sampling it is in `error` with `reason`
  `asset N: the renderer refused its WxH etc2rgba texture` (or `etc2rgb`).
  `tools/etc2_test/etc2_encode.py` encodes both.

An asset is not drawn and never makes its target wanted. The service keeps
its pixels, writes them whole into each new scene of its target and in place
as they change, before the layers, within the shared upload budget. A layer
that samples an asset is stalled until the asset has pixels, and waits while
the asset's buffer does not hold them whole.

### Choosing a pixel format

| Format | Bytes a pixel | Alpha | Changed after it is sent |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rgba8` (image layer or asset) | 4 | yes | yes, by rectangles |
| `r8` (asset) | 1 | no: one channel, read as `.r` (masks, glyphs) | yes, by rectangles |
| `etc2rgba` (asset) | 1 | yes | no: sent once |
| `etc2rgb` (asset) | 0.5 | no, opaque | no: sent once |
| video layer (4:2:0 atlas) | 1.5 | no | every frame, only the tiles that changed |

The cluster cannot change a compressed texture in place, on iDrive 7 or
iDrive 8: only uncompressed textures take updates. New pixels for an
`etc2rgba` or `etc2rgb` asset mean a new asset sent whole, which costs its
full size in upload and has not been tried per frame.

- **Artwork sent once, then animated** by moving, scaling, fading or
  switching sprite-sheet frames: a compressed asset, preloaded
  ([Animating preloaded assets](#animating-preloaded-assets)).
- **Pixels that change often** (drawn per frame, changing text, partial
  updates): `rgba8` or `r8`, updated by rectangle, or an effect shader that
  draws them.
- **Live video:** a video layer.

The trade-off is two limits all clients share: the service's 16 MB of pixel
memory (image layers and uncompressed assets count twice their size,
compressed assets once, a video layer about four times its 4:2:0 frame; mesh
geometry counts too) and the upload cap (5500 KB/s as shipped, lower while
the link struggles: the `budget` event). Compressed assets spare both;
uncompressed ones cost upload at each change.

### Shaders

GLSL ES 1.00. The renderer fills these uniforms wherever a shader declares
them, so in every shader they are reserved for it and must be mat4:
`u_mvp`, `u_mv`, `u_m`, `u_v`, `u_p` (model-view-projection, model-view,
model, view, projection) and `u_normal` (the inverse transpose of `u_mv`).
A part's vertex shader reads `attribute vec3 a_position` and any of
`vec3 a_normal`, `vec2 a_texcoord`, `vec4 a_color`; its geometry must carry
every attribute it reads.

### Uniforms

Without `type`, `v` is 1 to 4 numbers separated by spaces: a float, vec2,
vec3 or vec4. With `type` (`float`, `vec2`, `vec3`, `vec4`, `mat4`), `v` is
up to 1024 finite numbers, whole elements of the type: one value, or an
array uniform of that many elements (a mat4 is 16 numbers in GLSL's column
order). `part` names a mesh layer's part; an effect layer has none. A quad
or part holds at most 32 uniforms and 4096 numbers. A name the shader does
not have is dropped.

### Mesh geometry (`M`)

```
u32 ref | u32 part | u32 vertices | u32 indices | u8 mask |
f32 positions (xyz per vertex) |
[f32 normals (xyz)]    mask 1
[f32 texcoords (uv)]   mask 2
[f32 colors (rgba)]    mask 4
u16 indices (triangles)
```

All little-endian. 1 to 65535 vertices; 3 to 196605 indices, whole
triangles, each less than the vertex count; every value finite; the body at
most 4 MiB and exactly this long. Anything else is refused with an `error`
event (`op` `mesh`). The geometry becomes immutable resources in the
renderer: a part's geometry may be replaced, at most once a second, and its
bytes spend the shared upload budget.

### Animations

The renderer plays an animation by itself; nothing is sent per frame. `anim`
is the client's number for it (1 or more), unique within the layer: sending
it again replaces it, `stop` ends it and its property goes back to what the
client set. A layer plays at most 16.

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `part` | a mesh layer's part; absent: the layer's quad, or a mesh layer's camera |
| `property` | `rotate`, `translate`, `scale` or `uniform` |
| `name` | the uniform's name (`property` `uniform`) |
| `keys` | `t:v[,v,v,v] t:v ...`: `t` in ms from the start, ascending; every key the same number of values; at most 256 keys |
| `loop` | 1: from the first key again after the last; 0 (default): holds the last |
| `interp` | `linear` (default) or `step` |

Values a key takes:

| On | `rotate` | `translate` | `scale` | `uniform` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| an image or effect layer | 1: degrees clockwise about the pivot | 3: pixels right, down, out from its place | 3 | 1, 3 or 4: float, vec3, vec4 |
| a mesh part | 3: degrees about x, y, z, right-handed | 3 | 3 | 1, 3 or 4 |
| a mesh layer's camera | 3 | 3 | — | — |

Animations are kept, and start again when a scene is published again.

### Animating preloaded assets

Artwork sent once as assets is animated with no more pixels sent: an effect
or mesh layer samples it, and a uniform, a `set` or an animation changes what
is drawn.

- **A sprite-sheet frame:** the shader samples a sub-rectangle of the asset
  named by a uniform. Each `uniform` picks another frame (a message of a few
  dozen bytes), or an `animate` with `interp` `step` plays the frames in
  the renderer with nothing sent per frame (up to 256 keys).
- **Move, scale, rotate:** `set` `x`, `y`, `sx`, `sy`, `rotate`, or
  `animate` `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`.
- **Fade:** a uniform the shader multiplies alpha by (`opacity` is for
  video and image layers), set or animated.
- **Shader-driven motion:** `time` 1 gives the shader the renderer's clock.
- **Meshes:** a part samples an asset through `bind` with `part`, with its
  geometry's `a_texcoord`; its uniforms, transforms and animations as above.

A 4x2 sheet of 128x128 frames in one 512x256 `etc2rgba` asset (131,072
bytes, sent once), played at 12 frames a second and turning:

```
{"op":"asset","ref":1,"target":"panel","format":"etc2rgba","w":512,"h":256}
F ref 1, no rects, the sheet's 131,072 bytes
{"op":"layer","ref":2,"target":"panel","kind":"effect","x":800,"y":300,"w":128,"h":128,
 "fs":"precision mediump float;uniform sampler2D u_sheet;uniform vec4 u_cell;uniform float u_alpha;varying vec2 v_uv;void main(){vec4 c=texture2D(u_sheet,u_cell.xy+v_uv*u_cell.zw);gl_FragColor=vec4(c.rgb,c.a*u_alpha);}"}
{"op":"bind","ref":2,"sampler":"u_sheet","asset":1}
{"op":"uniform","ref":2,"name":"u_alpha","v":"1"}
{"op":"animate","ref":2,"anim":1,"property":"uniform","name":"u_cell","interp":"step","loop":1,
 "keys":"0:0,0,0.25,0.5 83:0.25,0,0.25,0.5 167:0.5,0,0.25,0.5 250:0.75,0,0.25,0.5 333:0,0.5,0.25,0.5 417:0.25,0.5,0.25,0.5 500:0.5,0.5,0.25,0.5 583:0.75,0.5,0.25,0.5 667:0,0,0.25,0.5"}
{"op":"animate","ref":2,"anim":2,"property":"rotate","loop":1,"keys":"0:0 4000:360"}
```

`u_cell` is the frame's top-left and size in texture coordinates (x, y, w,
h). Keep frames on 4-pixel boundaries for the compressed formats, and with
`bilinear` sampling leave a pixel of gap between them.

### Scene files

On a target with `<target>_scene_files` 1 (cluster-render.conf; 0, off, on
every target as shipped; the RAMSES 19 backend), a client may have the
service load a RAMSES scene file as the target's whole scene in place of
the layers: content authored beforehand, saved with its resource files
(`RamsesClient::saveSceneToFile`), drawn by its own cameras and passes, and
changed live by edits ([below](#scene-edits)).

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `file` | the scene file, an absolute path |
| `res` | its resource files, absolute paths separated by spaces (at most 16; none: empty) |
| `sha256` | the SHA-256 of `file`, then of each file of `res` in its order: hex, separated by spaces |
| `contend` | as a layer's |

The service runs as `hmi_5000` and any client may name a file, and a
malformed file can take the RAMSES client down with the service, so it takes
only files that a root install put in place and nobody else can change:
each file's real path (symlinks and `..` resolved) must be under
`/var/opt/`, a regular file, and it and every folder below `/var/opt/` on
the way owned by root and writable by no one else; and each file's SHA-256
the one given (the files at most 256 MB together: they are hashed then, in
the render loop). Anything else is refused with an `error` event (`op`
`scene`). The file is loaded when the target's scene is published; it keeps
the scene id it was saved with, which must be the target's
(`<target>_scene_id`; a panel that has fallen back has
`panel_fallback_scene_id`, README.md "Scene ids"), else the scene is in
`error` with the reason.

A target has at most one scene (another is refused: `the target has a
scene file already`). While it is there and has not failed to load, the
target is wanted, as by a layer that wants it, and every layer on it is
`waiting` with `reason` `scene <ref>` (the client's own scene) or
`scene of <app>`, as below an exclusive layer. The scene's `layer` events:
`waiting` (the target not shown yet: its state and reason, the `target`
event naming who holds the slot), `shown` once the display shows the target
with this scene (where the service sees the renderer's subscriptions, once
the renderer has it), `error` when the file did not load. A client sends
its values again on `shown`. `drop`, or the client gone, ends the scene:
with nothing else wanting the target, it stays shown through
`<target>_linger_ms` and the target is released; a target the layers want
is published again with them at once. A scene coming to a target, or going
from one the layers want, takes the target out of its slot and asks for it
again with its new scene.

`scene` sent again with the scene's ref (its target unchanged) loads the
new file in place: the scene is unpublished and published again with the
same id while the target keeps its slot, and its kept edits go. A `layer`
event follows even when the state is the same.

### Scene edits

`lines`: lines separated by newlines (`\r\n` too; empty ones skipped), each
a kind, a space and its value. `RE` is a POSIX extended regular expression
found anywhere in an object's name (as `grep -E`, no back-references), at
most 256 characters; numbers are separated by commas.

| Line | Sets |
|---|---|
| `--hide RE`, `--show RE` | the visibility of each node matching and of every node under it |
| `--move RE=x,y,z`, `--scale RE=x,y,z` | a node's translation, its scaling |
| `--rotate RE=x,y,z` | a node's rotation: degrees, in the scene's own convention (nothing converted) |
| `--viewport RE=x,y,w,h` | a camera's viewport: pixels, from the bottom-left as RAMSES has it |
| `--pass-off RE`, `--pass-on RE` | a render pass disabled, enabled |
| `--uniform RE:NAME=v[,v...]` | the uniform `NAME` of each matching mesh's appearance: as many whole elements as given and it has (float, vec2-4, mat2-4; int and ivec2-4 rounded); one bound to a data object is not set (`--set` it) |
| `--set NAME=v[,v...]` | the data object called `NAME` (the name, not a pattern): float, int, vec2-4 |

A line replaces the kept line with the same key, its kind (`--show` counts
as `--hide`, `--pass-on` as `--pass-off`) and what comes before its value
(up to the last `=`), and goes to the end. The kept lines, at most 1024,
are applied in that order to each scene the file is loaded into, so a
scene published again shows what the lines so far made of it. New lines
are applied once a tick, in the target's one flush (not while the target
is parked; none when they change nothing). A pattern is resolved once per scene and kind of object, and
cached by its text.

A malformed line is refused at once, the other lines of the message taken:
an `error` event, `op` `edit`, `line` the line, `reason` naming it and
why. A line that changes nothing (no object matches, no mesh has the
uniform, not a regular expression) is reported the same way, once per
loaded scene.

## Service to client

Every JSON message has `ev`.

| ev | Fields | When |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `proto`, `backend` (`id7`, or `id8` on iDrive 8), `targets` (`map:1088x480,panel:1920x720,hud:800x480`; on iDrive 8 `map:874x749,hud:353x203,guide:702x213,widget:2240x896,popup:2240x896`, then any a drop-in adds, README.md "iDrive 8"), `repeat` (1: takes `repeat`) | after the client's hello |
| `layer` | `ref`, `state`, `reason` | the layer's state changed |
| `target` | `target`, `state`, `holder`, `reason`, `retry_in_ms`, `rendering`, `guide_disabled`, `disabled` | a target's state changed |
| `budget` | `cap_kb_per_s`, `max_kb_per_s`, `floor_kb_per_s`, `reason` | the upload cap changed |
| `error` | `op`, `ref`, `reason`; `line` for an edit line | a message was refused, or an edit line changed nothing |
| `status` | `text` | after a status request; among its lines, one for each slot the KOMBI's latest reports name: `slot 0x203 status 2: 0x1000400 class 0 map 1, ...` (each row's content, class and map status) |

Layer states (a scene's too, [above](#scene-files)): `shown`; `waiting`
(its target is not shown yet or is taken, an asset it samples is not
written yet, or a scene file is on its target; `reason` says which);
`suspended` (below an exclusive layer); `stalled` (no content yet: no frame,
no part with geometry, an asset it samples without pixels; or a video's
frames stopped); `hidden`; `error` (the renderer refused it). Target states:
`idle`, `acquiring`, `parked` (mapped, behind the content the slot shows:
`holder` `stock` or `foreign` once the slot table names it, and `reason`
`parked behind stock`, `parked behind foreign`, or `parked` until then; on
iDrive 8: offered, until the cluster shows it), `shown`, `lingering`,
`waiting` (with `holder` `stock` or `foreign` when
someone else holds the slot, and `retry_in_ms` when on a timer),
`unavailable`. `rendering`, for a shown or lingering target: `verified`
(the display's renderer is subscribed to its scene), `checking` (not
subscribed yet; after 1.5 s shown the service asks for the slot again),
`unobservable` (the service cannot see subscriptions); `none` otherwise.
`guide_disabled`: 1 while a guide hold following the target (`map`) is
disabled by the mapping guard or by the display refusing its slot, so the
stock HMI's guidance box shows whatever the layers' `guide_hold`; else 0.
`disabled`: 1 while the target's own mapping is disabled by the mapping
guard (the HUD's, README.md "Mapping guard"): it is never asked for, its
layers stay waiting; else 0.

On a head unit that refuses the service (README.md "Supported head
units") no `hello` comes: a `status` request gets `text` `not supported on
this car (head unit: ...)`, and every other message an `error` event with
that `reason`.
