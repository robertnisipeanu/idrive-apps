# collect-logs.sh — gather what a report of the map on the cluster needs into
# one archive, to send back. Run it on the head unit as root:
#
#   sh /var/opt/waze-on-cluster/current/collect-logs.sh
#
# It writes /tmp/woc-logs-<UTC date and time>.tar.gz and prints its path:
# both tools' log files (with their .1), the renderer's and the capture's
# status files, this boot's journal of the tools and of carplay (what the
# journal still holds), the list of boots, the carplay patch probe (where its
# edit sites are in this carplay), the tools' folders, their local settings,
# the time and the uptime. Anything missing is left out. It changes
# nothing on the unit. POSIX sh, for the unit's shell.
