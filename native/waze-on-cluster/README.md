# waze-on-cluster

Shows the CarPlay instrument-cluster map (Waze, Apple Maps or Google Maps)
on the instrument cluster of a BMW with an iDrive 7 head unit (MGU), which
the stock software does not do. It runs as root tools on the head unit and is
driven from the HMI by the companion app
[robertn_waze_cluster](../../apps/robertn_waze_cluster).

CarPlay sends the cluster map only as H.264 video, with no map data, so this
is a video pipeline:

1. **Ungate the second display.** A reversible patch to
   `/usr/bin/carplay` makes `KI_KOMBI_VARIANT` 7 resolve to a supported
   cluster variant, makes CarPlay start the cluster stream itself, and
   advertises the size the map is shown at ([patch/PATCH.md](patch/PATCH.md)).
2. **Capture.** CarPlay sends the stream as RTP to its stock media-bus sink,
   AVB stream `media_transport.avb_streaming.15`; the render joins it as an
   extra receiver, in-process. It also listens on a local UDP port and a FIFO,
   which other sink patches can point at.
3. **Decode.** The receive threads only queue each packet; one decode
   thread depacketises RTP to H.264 Annex B (`src/rtp_h264.*`) and decodes it
   with the unit's Intel Media SDK / VAAPI on `/dev/dri/renderD128` to the
   picture's own Y, U and V planes, through any lost packets ("Losses").
4. **Draw.** Each frame goes to the shared cluster renderer,
   [cluster-render](../cluster-render), as a
   video layer (`src/map_feed.*`). The renderer owns the RAMSES participant,
   the DCSM slots and one upload budget for all its clients.

## Install and remove

Install the app `robertn_waze_cluster` from the catalog of
[idrive-apps](https://github.com/robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps)
through the [mgu Store](https://github.com/robertnisipeanu/mgu-store). The
app requires this tool (0.6.0); this tool requires `cluster-render` 0.3.2 and
`mgu-deploy` 0.7.0, the deploy tool version that runs activate and deactivate
hooks. Requirements resolve across catalog sources.

**Install.** The deploy tool runs `patchd.js activate` as root. It writes the
patch Enable map writes, keeps the running binary linked, and never stops,
kills or restarts CarPlay. The Store shows a restart pending; the app shows
`Patch pending — reboot to activate`. One head-unit start runs the patched
CarPlay and starts this tool's services. The hook leaves CarPlay as it is,
and the app says why and offers Enable map, when Disable map was used, when
the patcher cannot find or recognise one of its edit sites in the binary or
something else modified it, or when `carplay.service` starts another program.
An update brings an older patch of ours up to date.

**Remove.** In the Store, remove the app, then the tool (refused while the
app is installed). `patchd.js deactivate` reverts only our byte regions,
keeps other tools' edits and drops our backup; the deploy tool then removes
this tool's services and files. The renderer and the deploy tool stay. The
next head-unit start runs the original CarPlay. Details: PATCH.md
"Install-time activation".

## Using it

On the app's page, **Enable map** asks the root patch daemon `patchd` to
apply the patch and **Disable map** reverts it, which turns the feature off:
without the patch the phone sends no cluster stream. A change takes effect
when CarPlay next starts. `patchd` restarts CarPlay at once only where recmgr
loaded `carplay` in both restart lists at this boot (PATCH.md "Activation");
otherwise the app shows **Restart head unit**, a normal system reboot.

Set **Instrument cluster > Central display area** to **Map view**: the
cluster shows the stock map, the Waze map replaces it while CarPlay's cluster
stream is live, and the stock map is back when the stream ends. **Off** works
too, with an empty centre instead of the stock map. With Route preview or
Assisted Driving View the cluster's own content takes the centre. After
changing the setting, CarPlay may need reconnecting before the map returns:
the change can freeze the phone's cluster stream (below).

Then connect the iPhone to CarPlay. Waze needs its server-side flag 1006 for
the alternate display. The phone sends SPS, PPS and an IDR only at the start
of a stream, so the render service runs from boot, joins the media bus at
once (retrying every second until the AVB bridge is up), and decodes from the
stream's first SPS whether or not the map is shown. The app need not be open.

The map comes up at the first decoded frame in the native central-map slot
`0x100` (scene `0x010004f0`, 1088x480), under the gauges, and stays while the
stream is live: while carplay holds the phone's connection for the cluster
stream, TCP port 6031 owned by carplay's uid 13002 in `/proc/net/tcp6`,
however few frames come (how often a static map sends a frame depends on the
phone: one about every ten seconds, another about 30 a second).
When that connection ends (the phone unplugged, the session or the stream
ended) the map is taken down at the next check, once a second, and the slot
returns to the cluster's own content; the next stream maps it again. No
frame for `idle_ms` (60 s) takes it down too. Without that connection
(carplay took another port) or if `/proc/net` cannot be read, a frame within
`stall_ms` (6 s) counts as live. That the phone keeps the connection through
a static map and closes it when the stream ends is still to be confirmed on
the car.

While the map is up, a session the cluster ends (the stock map taking the
slot back, a refusal, no answer) is started again after 2, 5, 10, 20, then
every 30 s. The app shows `Starting map…` while the renderer starts, and a
map error only when the renderer stays unreachable for 15 s.

A frozen stream, frames still coming (on the car 15-21 a second) but all the
same blank picture, is taken down after 10 s (`freeze_ms`, at least
`freeze_min_fps` 3 a second): the stock map shows (in Off, an empty centre)
and the app shows `Map frozen — reconnect CarPlay`. The map is back with the
first changed frame. A stream that has shown no picture yet is frozen only
after three times as long (30 s), frames still coming: a phone starting its
stream sends the same blank picture for a couple of seconds and pauses
before the map's first. A stream starts when CarPlay's cluster stream
becomes live and ends when it stops being live. Blank: all but one in a thousand of the sampled luma
values within 17 levels. A static map is never frozen, however many frames
the phone sends: some phones send one about every ten seconds, others keep
their full rate.

A render that missed the stream's start decodes nothing until a new stream.
Where recmgr allows a CarPlay restart, `patchd` restarts CarPlay after 15 s of
stream with no keyframe, rate-limited (PATCH.md "Stream resync"); elsewhere,
reconnect the phone. If a patched CarPlay crash-loops,
`waze-on-cluster-recovery.service` restores the original binary on disk
(PATCH.md "Boot recovery").

**Losses.** The phone sends a keyframe only at the start of its stream, so
the render decodes through a lost packet:

- The AVB bridge's callback and the UDP reader only copy each packet into a
  queue of 4096 packets or 6 MB (about 4 s of the stream) and return; one
  decode thread depacketises and decodes them in order. Past the queue's
  headroom the oldest packets are dropped, and counted. A slot keeps a
  buffer of at most 2 KB once its packet is out, so large datagrams leave
  no memory behind. The receive threads run at nice -5 (the unit file's
  `LimitNICE`), the decode thread at the service's nice 0. The FIFO reader, a byte stream that holds its
  writer back, decodes on its own thread.
- Every frame is decoded, since each builds on the one before, but only the
  newest gets a picture. While a later frame's first packet (a new RTP
  timestamp) is already queued, the frames decoded meanwhile skip the
  picture: no scaling, packing, level rounding or hand-off. A decode slower
  than the phone's frame rate thus skips pictures instead of falling
  behind; the wait in the queue stays within about one picture's output
  and a few frames' decoding. A decoder slower than the stream even
  without the pictures is logged when every packet has waited over 200 ms
  for 5 s (`waze: the decoder is behind the stream: …`), and again when a
  packet waits under 100 ms (`waze: the decoder caught up with the stream
  after 37 s behind it (packets waited at most 2400 ms)`).
- A sequence gap drops only the NAL unit it cut (an FU-A); every slice after
  it goes to the decoder, which conceals what is missing. The frames are
  shown as decoded: the map can show smudges until the phone codes those
  areas again, and MSDK's per-frame `Corrupted` flags are counted. A decoder
  that has never started still waits for the stream's first SPS. Only
  30 access units in a row that fail to decode give the sequence up; the
  decoder then waits for a keyframe as at the start, and the resync above
  applies.
- A gap followed by an SPS is a new stream (the phone reconnected or
  CarPlay asked for a new one), logged as `waze: a new stream from avb
  (sequence 40000, expected 17)`, not a loss. Any other gap is a loss,
  logged with the jump, its source and whether the receive queue dropped
  it (`waze: lost 5 packets of the stream from avb (sequence 1240, expected
  1235); decoding through it`), and so are the first corrupted frame after
  it and the first clean one begun after it (`waze: the picture is clean
  again 150 ms after the loss at 12:39:50 (3 corrupted frames)`), at most
  10 such lines a minute.
- Decoding through a loss, the map shows and the status has no reason
  for it; `probe.txt`'s `stream:` line says `lost part of the stream at
  12:39:50; decoding through it` until that clean frame. The status's
  `reason`, which the app shows, is `Stream lost — reconnect CarPlay`, or
  `Stream lost — restarting CarPlay` once `patchd` has decided for this
  wait that it will restart CarPlay (PATCH.md "Stream resync"), while the
  stream arrives with nothing decoded for 2 s (a render started
  mid-stream, or a loss the decoder does not decode through) and while the
  decoder has given up its sequence. The detail, with when that began and
  `patchd`'s reason for holding the resync, is in the log (`waze: stream
  lost: the stream arrives with nothing decoded since 12:40:50; resync
  held: recmgr did not load a carplay restart entry this boot`) and in
  `probe.txt`. A status line whose only change is the stream's reason is
  logged at most once every 10 s.

From a shell, `waze-on-cluster -c <conf> run map|panel|hud` (`sail` is an
alias of `map`) sets the target until the service restarts and prints the
status.

## Status and diagnostics

Once a second the render writes, in `/run/waze-on-cluster/` (mode 0644):
`status.json`, the status the app shows (`state` idle, starting, showing,
frozen or error; `page`; `reason`; the shared upload cap as `upload_cap_kb_per_s` and
why as `upload_reason`, also in the app's status event); `probe.txt`, the
sources, the depacketiser (`rtp: packets nals aus seq_gaps lost dropped bad`),
the receive queue (`queue: N dropped, at most M of 4096 packets waiting, K KB
held`), its backlog (`backlog: the oldest packet waiting N ms, the longest
wait M ms; K frames decoded without a picture to catch up`, with `; the
decoder is behind the stream` while it is), the stream (`stream: whole` or
the detail above), the decoder, the late-join verdict, the noise filter's
tile differences and the renderer's own status; and `stream.json`, for
`patchd`'s resync. `patchd` answers `{"cmd":"logs"}` with CarPlay, AVB and
DLT marker lines and its own log.

Every line the render logs also goes to
`/var/opt/waze-on-cluster/log/waze-on-cluster.log` (`log_file`) with its UTC
time, so it outlives the journal's few minutes on the unit, restarts and
reboots; past `log_file_kb` (512) the file becomes `waze-on-cluster.log.1`.
The service makes the directory, owned by `hmi_5000`, at each start; the
deploy tool removes it with the rest of `/var/opt/waze-on-cluster`. The log
has the status when its state, reason or target changes, each loss and a
decoder behind the stream (above), and once a minute while frames come, how
many were decoded, how many of those without a picture, changed and flagged
corrupted, whether the last picture was blank, the losses and the packets
they cost, the packets the receive queue dropped, and how long the decoded
packets waited in it:
`waze: 1840 frames decoded in the last minute, 12 without a picture to
catch up, 1 changed, 0 corrupted; the last picture is not blank; 0 losses
(0 packets), 0 dropped by the receive queue; packets waited 2.4 ms on
average, 61 ms at most`.

For a report, run as root on the unit
`sh /var/opt/waze-on-cluster/current/collect-logs.sh`: it writes
`/tmp/woc-logs-<UTC date and time>.tar.gz` and prints its path. The archive
holds both tools' log files (cluster-render's too), the files in
`/run/cluster-render/` and the three above, this boot's journal of the
render, `patchd`, the recovery service, cluster-render and carplay, the list
of boots, `ls -l` of both tools' folders, their `*.local.conf`, the date and
the uptime.

Sockets: `/dev/shm/waze-on-cluster/ctl.sock` (the render's status and log,
group `tm_oap_app`; a connection also starts the service) and
`/dev/shm/waze-on-cluster/patch.sock` (`patchd`, `root:tm_oap_app`, 0660).
The app's README lists both protocols.

## Map size and upload

**Size.** The map covers the cluster's central map area, the stock map's
1088x480 rect on the 1920x720 panel (138x61 mm). The patch advertises exactly
that, so the phone renders those pixels, the decoder passes them through
unscaled and the texture maps onto the area one to one. In the whole-panel
slot `0x203` the map is centred at (416, 120) with everything around it
transparent. `tex_size` must equal the size the patch advertises.

**Texture.** The planes are packed into one R8 atlas, Y in rows 0–479 and U
and V side by side in rows 480–719 (783,360 B), which the renderer's shader
converts as full-range BT.601. The renderer keeps one persistent buffer and
writes only changed 64x64 tiles in place, one flush per update, so the
cluster never shows a half-written frame. (A new texture per frame held the
map to 3–4 frames a second on the car.)

**Noise filter** (`dirty_threshold` 8, `dirty_settle_ms` 1000). The phone
keeps coding residuals on a still map, mostly within 3 levels. A tile is
written only when it differs from what the cluster holds by more than the
threshold, or after `dirty_settle_ms`; a parked map costs about 1.6 updates a
second.

**Fast motion** (`pan_blocks` 1). An update whose exact write costs more than
261,120 B and more than the budget allows goes as 4x4 colour blocks at a
third of the bytes, slightly softer (38.8 dB mean on a recorded Waze capture;
street names and icons readable). The next update the budget covers, or a
quarter second later, brings the exact picture back. `waze-on-cluster
bench-pack <I420 file>` times the packing on the unit.

**Rate.** `target_fps` (30) is a ceiling on an exact grid; only the newest
frame waits, so the map skips ahead and never shows a backlog, and the
decoder skips the pictures of frames it is behind on ("Losses"). Real Waze
sent up to about 16 frames a second on the car.

**Upload budget.** The budget belongs to cluster-render and is shared by all
its clients: a 5500 KB/s ceiling, stepping down by 500 KB/s to 2000 KB/s on
sustained congestion and recovering slowly. Set it with `upload_kb_per_s` in
`/var/opt/cluster-render/cluster-render.local.conf`. This tool's own
`upload_kb_per_s` and `upload_burst_ms` keys are accepted and ignored with a
warning naming that file. On the car 8000 KB/s made the cluster flash black;
6000 KB/s stayed smooth with packed motion and no failed writes, but the
cluster once removed a shown map after a minute averaging 5774 KB/s, so the
ceiling sits below that. Real Waze
transitions peaked at about 3.2 MB/s. Every head-unit participant shares
the link to the cluster, so an upload that outruns it can drop other contents
too. Details: the cluster-render README.

Settings are in `waze-on-cluster.conf` (documented inline). Overrides go in
`/var/opt/waze-on-cluster/waze-on-cluster.local.conf`, which updates keep.

## The patch

`patch/carplay_patch.js` (Node 8, no dependencies) makes four edits after a
verified full backup. `patch/carplay_locate.js` finds each edit's site in the
build by its code and data and checks it before any write, so the patch
applies to any carplay build in which every site is found exactly once; a
build where one is not is left alone, with the reason. `carplay_patch.js
probe` (`woc-patch.sh probe`) shows where the sites are in a binary and
whether it is patchable, without writing. The build the patch was proven on,
carplay 22.28.3, also has to match its shipped SHA-256 before the first edit.
Its sites:

| Edit | What it does | Where (carplay 22.28.3) |
|---|---|---|
| variant | jump-table slot for `KI_KOMBI_VARIANT` 7 → IC_HIGH or IC_MID | 4 B at `0x2ba4f0` |
| sink | second-stream sink URL: stock `avb://`, or `udp://…`, `file://…` | ≤ 59 B at `0x2a20b0` |
| selfstart | `onSuggestUi`'s `setStreamStatus(AVAILABLE)` call → `requestStream()` | rel32 at `0x18176c` |
| resolution | IC_HIGH geometry → 1088x480 px at 138x61 mm, safe area 504x368+286+72 | four 8 B immediates at `0x20ca32`–`0x20ca7c` |

`patchd` and the install hook apply `--panel high` with the stock sink.
`woc-patch.sh` is the shell path, for experiments: `status`, `probe`,
`verify`, `revert [--force]`, and `apply high|mid` with `--avb` (the app's
sink), no flag (`udp://127.0.0.1:20557`), `--capture` (FIFO) or `--sink
<url>`, plus `--res WxH|stock` and `--safe WxH+X+Y|full`. It remounts `/` read-write only
for the write. **Never `systemctl stop` or `restart` carplay**: that
power-cycles the head unit, and so does any CarPlay death unless recmgr
loaded `carplay` in both restart lists at this boot. `revert` refuses a
binary it does not recognise as a patched form of the backup
(`/usr/bin/carplay.woc-orig`) unless given `--force`.

## Safety

- The patch is the only change to a BMW binary. It is reversible and fully
  backed up, checks every edit site before writing, refuses a build where a
  site is not found or not recognised, is written by atomic rename, and
  takes effect at the next CarPlay start. Its first apply to a proven build
  (PATCH.md) also requires the whole file to be the shipped one; on any
  other build, and once its backup exists, only the four sites are checked.
  Removal reverts our edits only.
- `patchd` runs as root. It accepts only `apply` (panel `high|mid`, mode
  `avb|udp|fifo`), `revert`, `reboot`, `status`, `logs` and the capture
  commands; no value reaches a shell or a path. It checks `/` is read-only
  again after every write. It applies no patch on its own; its only
  unrequested action is the rate-limited stream resync. `reboot` is honoured
  only while a change is pending.
- No debug arming: the services are normal units whitelisted in recmgr.
- Nothing is mapped on the cluster before the first decoded frame or after
  the frames stop. The map never alters the gauges' data.
- The render runs as `hmi_5000` with the groups `video` (the DRM render
  node), `mgu_ufipc` (the AVB bridge's shared memory; the receiver fails
  without it) and `tm_oap_app` (the renderer's socket).

## Diagnostic capture

CarPlay's projection-config markers are on DLT only during a phone
connection. Press **Capture logs**, then reconnect the phone; the window lasts
up to 5 minutes and **Stop capture** ends it early. `patchd` keeps the
markers until it restarts. The capture service is a root service, so it
starts only after a reboot following its install.

`waze-on-cluster-capture.service` sends BMW's DLT control request (service
`0xf13`, as `dlt-control -u -z 1`) over `/run/dlt-files/dlt-ctrl.sock`, waits
for the acknowledgement and checks the TCP 3490 listener through procfs. It
never edits DLT configuration or restarts CarPlay. It refuses unless a DLT
client is registered, the listener is closed and the newest state record in
`/run/logntrace/` says unambiguously whether tracing was OFF or BUFFER. It
records ownership under `/run/woc-dlt-capture` before turning tracing on, and
restores the recorded mode at the deadline, on stop and in `ExecStopPost`
(also after SIGKILL). A failed restore shows as `restore_failed` in the app,
is retried every 5 s and blocks a new capture. DLT is shared ECU-wide:
restoring closes its TCP clients, and no other tracing tool should run during
a capture.

## Verified, and open

Verified on a car with real CarPlay Waze: the alternate display, the AVB
capture (RTP payload type 96, single NAL units and FU-A), the decode, the map
in slot `0x100` under the gauges with normal colours, readable text and
correct transitions. A 10-packet slice of a car capture is the depacketiser's
golden test (`test/data/stream15_start.rtp`).

Open: how the unit's hardware MSDK conceals a lost slice or picture, and
whether it flags those frames `Corrupted` (and propagates the flag to the
frames that reference them); that the phone's SPS is exactly the advertised 1088x480; how packed
motion reads during a long fast pan while driving; whether the alternate
display survives iOS and Waze updates (flag 1006 is server-side). Waze sends
no guidance metadata, so this shows map pixels, not data-driven directions.

## Building and testing

```sh
make test                         # host tests: NAL, RTP, keyframe wait, the map feed against
                                  # cluster-render, the renderer's kit, patch/patchd/recovery/DLT
make test-x86                     # the C++ tests with the unit's toolchain in Docker (SSE2 paths)
make target                       # build/target/waze-on-cluster in Docker, imports checked
make test-firmware ROOTFS=<dir>   # DLT capture against the unit's own dlt-daemon in Docker
```

`CR` names cluster-render's tree, `../cluster-render` by default. Its tree
also gives the log, the config, the unit's ABI tools and the build image.
The target builds in Ubuntu 18.04 (gcc 7.5, glibc 2.27, the unit's libstdc++ ABI) against
link-only stubs of the unit's libmfx, libva, libva-drm and IAS AVB bridge
(`abi/*.symbols`), with every import checked.

The patch tests run against a copy of the unit's `/usr/bin/carplay`
(carplay 22.28.3, sha256
`ddb33e33161387c6479c391684b3d019b0de54ecfcee8d6877eca94aa62f3e50`) named by
`CARPLAY_BIN`; without it they are skipped (`SKIP`). The locator's test runs
on synthetic builds without it. The repository carries no BMW binary. `test-firmware` runs the unit's own dlt-daemon, libdlt and
dlt-receive from `ROOTFS`, an extracted root file system of the unit.
