/* patchd — the root helper that applies and reverts the carplay patch when the
 * iDrive app asks, so no shell is needed. It is the same model as
 * mgu-updater: a root daemon on a /dev/shm socket (root:tm_oap_app, 0660) that
 * the unprivileged app drives.
 *
 * It does two privileged things. On an apply/revert request it runs the vetted,
 * reversible carplay_patch.js (which refuses an unknown binary and keeps a
 * verified backup), with / remounted read-write only for the write. The new
 * binary takes effect when carplay next starts: patchd restarts carplay only
 * when recmgr loaded a carplay restart entry this boot and systemd loaded the
 * tool's carplay.service drop-in (restartCarplay), else at the next head-unit
 * start. It applies no patch on its own. Explicit
 * capture commands go to a separately supervised DLT helper; reading logs does
 * not change tracing mode. It also reads which Wi-Fi band wireless CarPlay
 * runs on (wifi_band.js), from wpa_supplicant's D-Bus, which only root may
 * use, and reports it in its status.
