/* patchd — the root helper that applies and reverts the carplay patch when the
 * iDrive app asks, so no shell is needed. It is the same model as
 * mgu-updater: a root daemon on a /dev/shm socket (root:tm_oap_app, 0660) that
 * the unprivileged app drives.
 *
 * It does two privileged things. On an apply/revert request it runs the vetted,
 * reversible carplay_patch.js (which refuses an unknown binary and keeps a
 * verified backup), with / remounted read-write only for the write. The new
 * binary takes effect when carplay next starts: patchd restarts carplay only
 * when recmgr loaded a carplay restart entry this boot (restartCarplay), else
 * at the next head-unit start. It applies no patch on its own. The same
 * restart, rate-limited, starts a new phone stream when the render reports it
 * cannot decode the running one (checkResync). Explicit capture commands go to
 * a separately supervised DLT helper; reading logs does not change tracing
 * mode.
 *
 * Protocol (newline-delimited JSON, one object per line):
 *   app -> patchd  {"cmd":"status"}
 *                  {"cmd":"apply","panel":"high"|"mid","mode":"fifo"|"udp"|"avb"}
 *                    all modes apply the variant gate + self-start; they differ
 *                    only in the sink. avb = stock avb:// sink (the mode the app
 *                    applies; the render joins the media bus); udp = udp://
 *                    stream sink (the bridge accepts a stream where it rejects a
 *                    file); fifo = file:// FIFO sink
 *                  {"cmd":"revert"}
 *                  {"cmd":"reboot"} activate a deferred patch with a normal
 *                                   system reboot (so carplay next starts from
 *                                   the patched binary). Only when a change is
 *                                   actually pending (the activation-pending
 *                                   marker exists); never stops/restarts
 *                                   carplay. reboot-reply carries ok/reason.
 *                  {"cmd":"logs"}   carplay + marker + avb log lines, dlt-receive health, patchd log
 *                                   (to the asker, read-only)
 *                  {"cmd":"capture-start"|"capture-stop"|"capture-status"}
 *                                   (capture-reply to the asker; every client gets
 *                                   ev capture, also once a second)
 *   patchd -> app  {"ev":"status","state":...,"panel":...,"mode":...,"res":...,"safe":...,"reason":...,"carplay":...,
 *                   "pending":...,"conflict":...}

 *                    mode (when patched): fifo | udp | avb
 *                    res, safe (when the IC_HIGH geometry is patched): the
 *                    advertised size "WxH" and its safe area "WxH+X+Y", else null
 *                    carplay (after an apply/revert that changed the binary):
 *                    restarted | deferred (takes effect at the next head-unit
 *                    start; state is unknown with that reason until then)
 *                    pending: apply | revert, while a written change waits for
 *                    the next head-unit start (carplay is then deferred)
 *                    conflict: why the patch is not applied when the tool is
 *                    installed (a binary the patcher cannot patch, one
 *                    something else modified, a carplay.service that starts
 *                    another program)
 *                  {"ev":"log","line":...}   the backlog on connect, then each new line
 *
 * Install-time activation (the deploy tool's activate and deactivate hooks,
 * run as root once a version is in place and before it is removed):
 *
 *   patchd.js activate     applies what Enable map applies to an original or
 *                          an older patch of ours, unless the user reverted
 *                          it or a conflict stands; writes only, never stops
 *                          or restarts carplay: the change waits for the next
 *                          head-unit start (pending apply)
 *   patchd.js deactivate   reverts our patch the same way (pending revert)
 *                          and drops our backup
 *
 * Each prints a JSON line last: "status" what it did, "reboot" why a head-unit
 * start is needed. It exits non-zero only when it changed nothing and could
 * not do its job (the install is then rolled back, the removal refused); a
 * refusal of the patcher to touch a binary it does not know is a conflict,
 * not a failure.
