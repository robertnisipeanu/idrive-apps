/* MapFeeds: the decoded map on one or two renderer targets at once - the

 *
 * Each target is its own MapFeed (map_feed.h): its own connection to the
 * cluster renderer and its own contending video layer, so each slot is asked
 * for, held, taken over and released on its own, within the one upload
 * budget the renderer shares between all its clients. A frame goes to the
 * first feed without a copy and to the second as a copy. The stream's
 * liveness and freeze go to every feed.
 *
 * The app sees one status: its target is the spec ("map+hud"), its state the
 * first feed's unless another one errs or the first is not showing while
 * another is, and the page names a second feed's state when it differs. */
