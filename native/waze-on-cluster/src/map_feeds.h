/* MapFeeds: the decoded map on the cluster, on the HUD, on both or on
 * neither, as the two settings say.
 *
 * The cluster's feed (map_feed.h), on `map` (or `panel` from a shell), is
 * there while the cluster is on; off, nothing of it exists, so the KOMBI
 * shows its own content and no guide hold is asked for. The HUD's is made
 * while the HUD is on, beside the cluster's on either target. Off, nothing
 * of it exists: no connection, no layer, no thread, no copy. With neither,
 * wants_frames() is false: the capture decodes without pictures.
 *
 * Each feed is its own connection to the cluster renderer and its own
 * layer, so each slot is asked for, held and released on its own. A new
 * picture goes to the cluster's feed without a copy; the HUD's feed gets a
 * copy of the newest (MapFeed::latest) when its next frame is due, at most
 * hud_fps a second, and scales it on a worker thread to the size it is
 * shown at. A picture the same as the last goes to each feed as a repeat:
 * the cluster's last frame and the HUD's last scaled one again, with no
 * copy and no scaling, so both layers stay fed. cluster-render writes the
 * HUD's frames from the HUD's share of the upload budget (its README.md
 * "Upload budget"), never packed: a frame goes while the share has any
 * allowance left, into debt, and waits while it is in debt.
 *
 * The HUD alone takes each frame itself, without a copy, with the whole
 * upload budget, at most hud_fps a second, and repeats as with the cluster.
 * A feed made while the other is there starts from its newest picture.
 *
 * The app's status is the cluster's (state off while it is off), with the
 * HUD's own state beside it (FeedStatus::hud_state): off, disabled as
 * cluster-render reports it, or its feed's state. */
