/* VideoProducer: the CarPlay cluster stream from capture to decoded frames.
 * It owns the AVB, UDP and FIFO sources, the RTP depacketiser (rtp_h264.h)
 * and the MSDK/VAAPI decoder (decoder_msdk.h), and keeps the newest decoded
 * frame as a 4:2:0 atlas (yuv_atlas.h) with its levels rounded, for the map
 * feed (map_feed.h) to hand to the shared cluster renderer. Only the newest
 * frame waits: each decoded frame replaces one not yet taken.
 *
 * Decoder lifecycle (warm decoder). The phone sends SPS, PPS and an IDR only
 * when its stream starts (twice in the first second: the opening keyframe and
 * the one requestStream forces), then non-IDR slices only (VERIFIED on the
 * car: none in the following 60 s). A decoder started after the stream began
 * would never sync. So the sources listen from service start (a failed join
 * or open is retried every second, retry_sources), the decoder comes up at
 * the stream's first SPS (a raw Annex-B feed: at its first bytes), decodes
 * from then on whether or not the map is shown, and stays up for the service
 * lifetime; a later stream resyncs at its own SPS.
 *
 * Threads. The AVB bridge's callback and the UDP reader only copy each
 * datagram into a bounded queue (packet_queue.h, kQueuePackets or
 * kQueueBytes, about 4 s of the stream) and return, at nice kReceiveNice
 * where the unit allows it (LimitNICE in the service); one decode thread
 * depacketises and decodes them in order at the process's own priority. The
 * FIFO reader, a byte stream whose writer waits while the pipe is full,
 * decodes on its own thread.
 *
 * Catch-up (backlog.h). Every frame must be decoded, since each refers to
 * the one before, but only the newest needs a picture. The receiver marks
 * each RTP timestamp's first packet; while a later frame's first packet is
 * still queued behind the packet being depacketised, a whole newer frame is
 * waiting, so the frames that packet completes are decoded without a
 * picture: no VPP, packing, level rounding, change sampling or hand-off.
 * The newest frame, with nothing complete behind it, gets the full output.
 * A decode slower than the stream thus skips pictures instead of falling
 * behind; the queue's waits, the frames skipped and a decoder that falls
 * behind even so go to the log and probe.txt.
 *
 * Losses (stream_health.h). A lost packet costs only the NAL unit it was in
 * (rtp_h264.h); the decoder decodes through it and the frames it flags
 * corrupted are shown all the same. A gap is a new stream or a loss
 * (gap_settler.h), a loss logged with its source and whether the receive
 * queue dropped it; only a frame of an access unit begun after the latest
 * loss can end a decode-through episode. */
