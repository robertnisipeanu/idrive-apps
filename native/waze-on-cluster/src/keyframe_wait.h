/* Whether the decoder joined the phone's stream after it started.
 *
 * The phone sends SPS, PPS and an IDR only when a stream starts (PATCH.md
 * "Stream resync"), so a decoder that missed the start, or gave up its
 * sequence (decoder_msdk.h), decodes nothing until the next stream. Sampled about once a second: while
 * the stream keeps arriving with no frame decoded and no SPS or IDR, the wait
 * grows from the first such sample. It is 0 once a frame decodes or the
 * stream stops arriving, and from a keyframe that arrives after the last
 * decoded frame (or before any) until a frame decodes: the stream carried a
 * keyframe and the decoder did not start or decode from it, which is not
 * what a resync is for. */
