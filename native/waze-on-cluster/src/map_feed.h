/* MapFeed: the decoded map as a video layer of the shared cluster renderer
 * (cluster-render, its PROTOCOL.md), and what the Waze app is told about it.
 *
 * One video layer, class content and contending with the stock map, on the
 * target the map goes to: `map` (the native central-map slot 0x100, whose
 * 1088x480 scene the map fills) unless a control start chose another; on a
 * whole-panel or HUD target it is the centred map area (map_geometry.h).
 * The renderer draws every frame the way waze-on-cluster always has (one
 * persistent R8 atlas written in changed tiles, packed fast motion, the
 * frame clock, newest frame only) within the budget all its clients share,
 * and maps the slot from the first frame. The layer is visible while
 * CarPlay's cluster stream is live and not frozen (set_stream): hidden, the
 * renderer lets the slot go and the stock map comes back. stall_ms, which
 * releases the slot once the frames stop that long, is only a backstop,
 * since how often a static map sends a frame depends on the phone (one about
 * every ten seconds, another about 30 a second). Frames handed
 * over while the renderer is not reachable are dropped; the client
 * reconnects by itself and the next frame shows.
 *
 * The app's status line follows the stream, the layer and its target: idle
 * until the first frame or while the stream is not live, frozen while the
 * stream is, starting while the slot is asked for or held by the stock map
 * and while the renderer starts, showing with the frames handed over a
 * second, error when the renderer refused the layer or stays unreachable.
 * Showing, and idle while the stream is live, carry the stream's own reason
 * (stream_health.h: the stream lost) when it has one. */
