/* MapFeed: the decoded map as a video layer of the shared cluster renderer
 * (cluster-render, its PROTOCOL.md), and what the Waze app is told about it.
 *
 * One video layer, class content and contending with the stock map, on the
 * target the map goes to: `map` (the native central-map slot 0x100, whose
 * 1088x480 scene the map fills) unless a control start chose another; on a
 * whole-panel or HUD target it is the centred map area (map_geometry.h).
 * The renderer draws every frame the way waze-on-cluster always has (one
 * persistent R8 atlas written in changed tiles, packed fast motion, the
 * frame clock, newest frame only) within the budget all its clients share,
 * and maps the slot from the first frame the visible layer has. The layer
 * is visible while CarPlay's cluster stream is live, not frozen and shows a
 * picture (set_stream, freeze_watch.h): hidden, the renderer lets the slot
 * go and the stock map comes back. stall_ms, which releases the slot once
 * the frames stop that long, is only a backstop, since how often a static
 * map sends a frame depends on the phone (one about every ten seconds,
 * another about 30 a second).
 *
 * Only what the renderer needs goes: a frame whose picture is the last one
 * again goes as a repeat (the client's), and nothing goes while the layer
 * is hidden or the renderer is not reachable. The newest frame not sent is
 * held, and goes with the next frame or repeat; when the layer shows again
 * it goes (or a repeat of the last one sent) before the layer is made
 * visible, so the renderer never draws an older picture first. A new
 * layer (another target) starts from a copy of the old one's newest. A
 * layer that scales (the HUD's) keeps the newest picture whole, scales it
 * once, at most video.fps a second, and sends a repeat as a repeat of its
 * last scaled frame.
 *
 * The app's status line follows the stream, the layer and its target: idle
 * until the first frame or while the stream is not live, idle with kWaiting
 * while the stream's picture is blank, frozen while the stream is, starting
 * while the slot is asked for or held by the stock map and while the
 * renderer starts, showing with the frames handed over a second, error when
 * the renderer refused the layer or stays unreachable. Showing, and idle
 * while the stream is live, carry the stream's own reason (stream_health.h:
 * the stream lost) when it has one, in place of kWaiting. */
