/* What losses in the phone's stream did to the picture, for the status
 * reason, the log, probe.txt and the minute line.
 *
 * The phone sends a keyframe only when its stream starts, so a loss is
 * decoded through: the decoder conceals what is missing and the map shows
 * smudges until the phone codes those areas again. The stream is whole;
 * decoding through a loss, from that loss until a frame the decoder does not
 * flag corrupted, decoded from an access unit that began after the latest
 * loss; or lost, while the stream arrives with nothing decoded for
 * kLostMs (the keyframe wait, keyframe_wait.h: a decoder that never started,
 * or one that conceals nothing), and while the decoder has given up its
 * sequence (decoder_msdk.h) until it starts a new one. A sequence jump
 * followed by an SPS is a new stream, not a loss.
 *
 * Only a lost stream has a status reason, short operator text; the map
 * shows through a loss. The detail, with when the episode began and
 * patchd's resync state, is for the log and probe.txt. Each loss, new stream
 * and return to a clean picture is a log line, at most kLinesPerMinute a
 * minute; the minute line counts them all. Not thread-safe. */
